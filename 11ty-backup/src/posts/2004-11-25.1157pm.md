<p>... and still no iTunes Music store available to Canada.</p>
<p>Very nice promo for Apple on Survivor tonight.  They used a Powerbook with an iSight to connect the 'survivor's to their loved ones back home.  The video quality looked a little too good to be true since they were connecting via satellite - and it turned out to be so as they had their loved ones hidden on the island.  So maybe it was just a good advertisement for Airport wireless and the iSight.  Either way, it looked cool for Apple.  I've tried the iSight and it works as good as advertised.</p>
