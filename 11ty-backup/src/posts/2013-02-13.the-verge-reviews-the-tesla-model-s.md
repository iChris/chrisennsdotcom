title: "The Verge Reviews the Tesla Model S"

<p>The video in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/2/12/3969260/going-the-distance-driving-tesla-model-s-in-the-real-world">The Verge's review</a> is worth checking out if nothing else. Plays like as much like a movie trailer as a review of a car.</p>
<p>The cars are $100,000 right now. But give it a few years and we'll be all buying cars like this.</p>
<p>An interesting thought - what kind of car will my 5 year old son be taking his driver's test in when he turns 16? When I was a kid there would've been no question in my parent's mind that I'd be driving some sort of newer version of a gas guzzling vehicle.</p>
<p>Now? Not only is it likely to be an electric vehicle of some sort, if the gas industry is disrupted enough by electric and other types of vehicles who's to say what else might pop up?</p>
