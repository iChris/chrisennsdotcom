<p>A very interesting article on the music business by John Densmore, (former?)drummer for The Doors. He talks about not selling the reason they don't sell their songs for commericals (even when offered a couple million and a computer by the president of Apple, Steve Jobs) and also about giving back at least 10% (a.k.a. tithing) to the world.</p>
<p>I went through a Door's phase back in high school (Oliver Stone's The Doors being one of the best rock/band movies made) and while a lot of their tunes are just drug induced ramblings - they did (and obviously still do) have a strong belief and respect for the art of the songs they wrote.</p>
