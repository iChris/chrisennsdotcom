<p>When you pay $100 for a printer that has $100 "worth" of ink in it, don't expect to have any sort of face-to-face troubleshooting/repair from the store you bought it from.</p>
<p>That may have worked 5 years ago when companies actually made money by selling a printer - but these days they just swap your printer for a new/refurbished one and send you on your way.</p>
