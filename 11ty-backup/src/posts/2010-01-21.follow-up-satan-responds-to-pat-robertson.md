title: "Follow Up:  Satan Responds to Pat Robertson"
---
<p>In a followup letter to <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2010/01/14/christians-give-christians-a-bad-name/">Pat Robertson</a>, the red-horned evil dude writes:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dear Pat Robertson,</p>
<p>    I know that you know that all press is good press, so I appreciate the shout-out. And you make God look like a big mean bully who kicks people when they are down, so I'm all over that action. But when you say that Haiti has made a pact with me, it is totally humiliating. I may be evil incarnate, but I'm no welcher.</p>
<p>The way you put it, making a deal with me leaves folks desperate and impoverished. Sure, in the afterlife, but when I strike bargains with people, they first get something here on earth -- glamor, beauty, talent, wealth, fame, glory, a golden fiddle. Those Haitians have nothing, and I mean nothing. And that was before the earthquake.</p>
<p>Haven't you seen "Crossroads"? Or "Damn Yankees"? If I had a thing going with Haiti, there'd be lots of banks, skyscrapers, SUVs, exclusive night clubs, Botox -- that kind of thing. An 80 percent poverty rate is so not my style. Nothing against it -- I'm just saying: Not how I roll.</p>
<p>You're doing great work, Pat, and I don't want to clip your wings -- just, come on, you're making me look bad. And not the good kind of bad.</p>
<p>Keep blaming God. That's working. But leave me out of it, please. Or we may need to renegotiate your own contract.</p>
<p>    Best, Satan</p></blockquote>
