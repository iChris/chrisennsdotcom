Many bands bring audience members on stage to perform a song with them - U2 did it quite often for a time - and you run the risk of getting a dud. Someone who says they can play but actually has no clue what they're doing and, on top of that, gets terrified standing next to their idol in front of 30,000 screaming fans. 

Dave Grohl and The Foo Fighters had one of the best moments of bringing a fan on stage back in 2018.

*A heads up that there's some very rock 'n roll and NSFW language in the videos*:

And then that video links to a follow-up concert where Dave Grohl addresses what happened with Kiss Guy and how he'll never be repeated again:

Grohl has the perfect mix of rock 'n roll, class, and humility in handling the situation. Such a professional.
