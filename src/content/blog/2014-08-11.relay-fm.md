<p>Congratulations to Stephen Hackett and Myke Hurley on the announcement of their new podcast network, <a href="https://relay.fm/">Relay FM</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.512pixels.net/blog/2014/8/introducing-relay-fm">Stephen:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  We've spent lots of money, lots of time and lots of energy in creating Relay FM. It's ours. We've molded it with our own hands; what it is and what it becomes is up to us and our amazing hosts. Relay is a labor of love, and I think it shows.

<blockquote><p>
  We just want to become the place you think of when you want to listen to some cool, interesting and fun shows. I want you to be able to see a show on Relay FM and know that it's going to be good. That's what we strive for every day.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In as much as someone might think a new podcast network would be bad and add competition to <a href="https://goodstuff.network">what I’m working on</a>, it's really not the case. Podcasting needs to become more familiar to more people so that we all rise together. And the only way that's going to happen is by having quality podcasts that draw people in to the medium.</p>
<p>Looking forward to hearing big things from Stephen, Myke and co. next week.</p>
