title: "The Swine Flu Will Kill Us All"

<p>Or maybe it won't?</p>
<p>As with a lot of things in science, it seems there's a bit of debate over whether the swine flu is as deadly as the media "doctors" would have us believe:</p>
<blockquote><p>Dirk Brockmann, a professor of engineering and applied mathematics at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., used a computer model of human travel patterns to predict how this swine flu virus would spread in the worst-case scenario, in which nothing is done to contain the disease.</p>
<p>After four weeks, almost 1,700 people in the U.S. would have symptoms, including 198 in Los Angeles, according to his model. That’s just a fraction of the county’s thousands of yearly flu victims.</p></blockquote>
