[MacRumors with all the details](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/watch-apple-wwdc-2020-keynote/) on how, where and when to watch Monday's keynote at the Worldwide Developer's Conference, including Apple's new [Apple Developer app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/apple-developer/id640199958) for macOS.

The only thing that could move me to spend money on Apple hardware or software is updated Apple TV hardware, and I don't really expect to see that at a developer conference.

I'm curious to see if Apple announces a transition to Arm based processors - away from Intel - but that likely won't be in any hardware you can buy, other than iOS devices, until 2021 at the earliest.

The usual macOS / iOS update announcements of what's to come in Apple's flagship operating systems will be interesting, but it feels hard to be truly surprised or genuinely excited about what's coming with each OS update. Which I think is a good thing. The fact that iOS and macOS are so polished is a good thing.

Just give me a new Apple TV so I can catch up on all the Apple TV+ content I've been waiting to watch and I'll be happy.
