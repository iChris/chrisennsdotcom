In case you missed the news, Microsoft is back in the browser game with a cross-platform web browser called [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) (no - not the one you accidentally started on your Xbox). It's built on the same open source code that powers [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/index.html) and so a lot of the same extensions and hacks that work on Chrome will also work on Edge - just without the sleazy data tracking of Google.

[Ashutosh KS writing for Hongkiat has a bunch of great tips for using Edge](https://www.hongkiat.com/blog/less-known-microsoft-features-and-how-to-use-them/) including clearing your browser history on exit, setting aside tabs for later, and Edge's ability to mark up a web page or PDF inside of the browser.
