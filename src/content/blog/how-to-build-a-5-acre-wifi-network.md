Going off the city grid but wanting to stay on the internet grid has long been a dream of mine that I can't afford to live out right now. But when I do, I'll be sure to look back at [this post by Mat Howie on how to build a reliable single wi-fi network](https://a.wholelottanothing.org/2020/07/13/how-to-build-a-5-acre-wifi-network-cheap-reliable-long-range-wireless-points-make-amazing-things-possible/):

> Last year I moved to a house on some property, and it had a separate garage a hundred feet or so away from the main house. At first, I tried using standard Orbi mesh networking points to connect them to each other but I couldn’t reliably get a wireless point in my house’s window to connect to another point inside the garage. So I started doing some research, and going down some rabbit holes.
