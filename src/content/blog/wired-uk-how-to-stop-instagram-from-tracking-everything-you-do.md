There's not a whole lot you can do, but Matt Burgess at Wired UK [has a few tips if you want to limit the tracking Instagram and Facebook try to do with your Instagram account](https://www.wired.co.uk/article/instagram-story-ads-privacy-delete):

> First off – everything you do on Instagram is tracked. Almost every online service you use collects information about your actions. Every thumb scroll made through your feed provides it with information about your behaviour. Instagram knows that you spent 20 minutes scrolling to the depths of your high-school crush’s profile at 2am.
