I’m really looking forward to trying out Minecraft Dungeons when it comes out next month - May 25 is the release date. 

This [review on Polygon]() gives me hope that they’ve put a lot of thought into how the game will play for adults and kids alike:

> Playing a Diablo-style hack-n-slash game with up to three small children sounds like a nightmare scenario, with players squabbling over equipment, support, and leveling. The genius of Minecraft Dungeons is that each of these potential fights have been neatly edited out of the game, or at least mitigated to such an extent than it’s a joy to play, even with children of various ages.
