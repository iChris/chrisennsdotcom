Having only ever heard the soundtrack, I'm excited to see and experience Hamilton in what is now the only way possible for anyone to watch it.

And clearly Disney believes it will be a huge draw as they've ended the free trials of Disney+ in advance of Hamilton's release so people can't sign up for free, watch Hamilton, and then cancel.
