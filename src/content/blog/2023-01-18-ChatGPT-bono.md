Since everyone else is having fun with [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com), I thought I'd give it a try with a few prompts related to my favorite band, U2. I tried a few random prompts to see what it came up with.

It's interesting to see how it clearly references articles on the web talking generally about the band, but then fills in gaps with enough words or phrases that don't totally give it away as being auto-generated text.

### Write a story about Bono becoming the lead singer of U2:

Once upon a time, in Dublin, Ireland, a young man named Paul David Hewson was just a regular guy living a normal life. He went to school, hung out with friends and dreamed of one day becoming a famous singer. Little did he know, that dream would soon become a reality.

One day, while walking through the streets of Dublin, Paul came across a flyer advertising a local talent show. Without hesitation, he decided to audition. His friends laughed at the idea, but Paul was determined to prove them wrong. He practiced day and night, perfecting his singing and stage presence.

The day of the audition arrived and Paul stepped onto the stage, microphone in hand. As soon as he began singing, the judges were blown away. They had never heard such an incredible voice before. They immediately offered him the chance to be the lead singer of a local band called U2.

At first, Paul was hesitant. He had never been in a band before, and he didn't know if he was ready for the responsibility. But the band members, Larry Mullen Jr, Adam Clayton, The Edge, convinced him to give it a try.

So Paul accepted the offer and began rehearsing with the band. They quickly realized that they had a chemistry that was undeniable. Together, they wrote and performed music that captivated audiences and earned them a reputation as one of the best bands in Ireland.

As U2's fame grew, Paul took on the stage name "Bono," and the band began to tour the world, playing to sold-out crowds everywhere they went. They became one of the most successful and influential bands of all time, known for their powerful lyrics, incredible stage presence and Bono's distinctive voice.

Years went by and Bono and U2 were still making music and touring, they had albums that have sold over 150 million copies worldwide, won 22 Grammy Awards and more. Bono became an advocate for humanitarian causes, he used his platform and influence to bring attention to poverty, disease, and social injustice around the world, and he continues to inspire people through his music and his actions.

And so, from that young man who dreamed of becoming a singer, to the lead singer of one of the most successful bands in the world, Bono's story is one of determination, hard work, and never giving up on your dreams.

### Write a story about The Edge deciding to produce new music for U2

Once upon a time, in Dublin, Ireland, a band called U2 was in a bit of a creative rut. They had been together for years, and while they had achieved great success and acclaim, they were starting to feel like they had done everything they could musically. The band members, Bono, Larry Mullen Jr, Adam Clayton and The Edge, were all feeling a bit lost and unsure of what to do next.

The Edge, whose real name is David Evans, had always been the band's primary guitarist and songwriter, but he had always been interested in exploring new sounds and experimenting with different styles of music. As the band was discussing their next move, The Edge took the opportunity to propose something new. He suggested that he take on the role of producer for the band's next album, and that they push themselves to try new things and take more risks.

The other band members were hesitant at first, they were comfortable with the way things were and were not sure if change was what they needed. But The Edge was persistent, and eventually, they all agreed to give it a try.

So The Edge set to work, and he began experimenting with new sounds and techniques in the studio. He brought in new instruments and experimented with different recording techniques, and he pushed the band to try things they had never done before.

It was a difficult process, but eventually, the band began to see the potential in what The Edge was doing. They started to feel excited about the music they were creating and they could sense that they were on to something special.

Finally, the album was completed and the band was ready to unveil their new sound to the world. They released it with a huge success. The album was a hit with critics and fans alike, and it earned them several Grammy Awards. The band was back on the top again, and they had The Edge to thank for it.

The Edge's willingness to take risks and try new things had breathed new life into the band and had helped them create some of the most innovative and exciting music of their career. From that day forward, U2 continued to release albums that were always pushing the boundaries of music and were always experimenting with new sounds.

And so, The Edge's decision to take on the role of producer and experiment with new sounds had not only saved U2's career, but it had also helped them become one of the most influential and respected bands in the world.
