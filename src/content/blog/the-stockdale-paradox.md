In [an interview](https://www.jimcollins.com/media_topics/TheStockdaleParadox.html) talking about his imprisonment and torture from 1968 to 1974, Admiral Jim Stockdale had this to say when asked how he didn't let it get him down or depressed:

> He said, “Well, you have to understand, it was never depressing. Because despite all those circumstances, I never ever wavered in my absolute faith that not only would I prevail—get out of this—but I would also prevail by turning it into the defining event of my life that would make me a stronger and better person. Not only that, Jim, you realize I’m the lucky one.”
>
> I said, “No, I don’t.”  
>
> He said, “Yes, because I know the answer to how I would do, and you never will.”
>
> A little later in the conversation, after I’d absorbed that and said nothing for about five minutes because I was just stunned, I asked him who didn’t make it out of those systemic circumstances as well as he had.
>
> He said, “Oh, it’s easy. I can tell you who didn’t make it out. It was the optimists.”
