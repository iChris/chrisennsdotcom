title: "My Favourite iOS Podcast App Gets an Update"
---
<p>If you asked me before today which iOS app was my favourite since iOS 8 came out, I'd have told you <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/pocket-casts/id414834813?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki">Pocket Casts</a>.</p>
<p>Then today Shifty Jelly updated Pocket Casts to version 5 and it became my slightly more favourite'er (it's a word ok) iOS podcast player.</p>
<p><strong>Then</strong> we noticed that not only was <a href="https://goodstuff.network/transmission">Transmission</a>, Kyle &amp; Kenny Roderick's awesome podcast, featured heavily throughout the website and app, they also used a hint of <a href="https://goodstuff.network/smym">Show Me Your Mic</a>'s artwork on their blog post announcement:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Screenshot-2014-11-06-21.08.50-600x456.png" alt="Screenshot 2014-11-06 21.08.50" width="600" height="456" class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-22139" /></p>
<p>Maybe someday I'll become blasé about seeing my podcast show art pop up around the web, but that day is not today.</p>
<p>After you've set up Pocket Cast on your iOS device of choice, be sure to check out their <a href="https://play.pocketcasts.com/">web app at play.pocketcasts.com</a>.</p>
<p>By the way, <a href="https://blog.shiftyjelly.com/2014/11/07/pocket-casts-5-for-ios-bigger-than-the-biggest/">here's a few things that are new in Pocket Cast 5</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refreshed for the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus.</li>
<li>Handoff support. For those of you that use our <a href="https://play.pocketcasts.com/">new web player</a> you can now tap one button on your mac, and it will open the same episode in the web player, auto-loaded to where you’re currently up to.</li>
<li>Actionable notifications. You can now add to Up Next and download directly from a notification, without having to open the app.</li>
<li>Per podcast notification settings, you can now choose to receive notifications for only the podcasts you care the most about.</li>
