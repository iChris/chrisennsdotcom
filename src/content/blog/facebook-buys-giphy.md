Big news in the GIF world with the announcement that [Facebook is buying Giphy for $400 million](https://www.axios.com/scoop-facebook-to-buy-giphy-for-400-million-4a75a359-833b-484d-b15b-87e94d3de017.html).

[John Gruber](https://daringfireball.net/linked/2020/05/15/facebook-giphy) on why Giphy is going to try and retain it's brand - which every company that's aquired always states that it's going to do:

> Of course Giphy is going to retain its own brand. If they renamed it to “Facebook Tracking Pixels”, usage might drop off.

I'm not sure who's behind [Tenor](https://tenor.com/) but it's the GIF search tool used inside of [Discord](https://discord.com/). I'd imagine there's a few companies who are concerned about privacy, like Apple with Messages which currently uses Giphy, reaching out for better integration support these days.
