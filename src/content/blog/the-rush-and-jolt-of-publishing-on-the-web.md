[What do you want to do when you grow up, kid?](https://robinrendle.com/notes/what-do-you-want-to-do-when-you-grow-up-kid/) by Robin Rendle is a great reminder of the power of anyone being able to publish something on the web:

> Someone was building an application of some kind and they were referencing something I had written for CSS-Tricks a few weeks prior. It was the most impossible, wonderful feeling I’ve ever had. And no, it’s not because of the fame and prestige although yes that is nice and I will take what I can get thank you very much. It’s the fact that this almost-college-dropout kid from a backwater town in the UK can write a little thing that helps someone on the other end of the world.
