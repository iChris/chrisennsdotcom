<p><a href="http://cabel.me">Cabel</a> is the founder of <a href="http://panic.com">Panic Software</a>, creator of great Mac apps like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/transmit/id403388562?mt=12">Transmit</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/coda-2/id499340368?mt=12">Coda</a>, and for his talk at XOXO 2013 he spoke about the process and toll of building a company and its products.</p>
<p>The mental struggle you go through in trying to <a href="http://lemonproductions.ca">build a business</a> and <a href="http://ssktn.com">a passion</a> is something I wasn't completely prepared for - and still deal with almost every week. Intense highs and even more intense lows that leave you crippled and wondering how you can face your spouse or your kids.</p>
<p>Like Cabel, I don't have an answer. I know for me the micro details are what bog me down and get my brain headed to darker places. When I'm able to take a step back and look at things at a macro level I can usually breath again.</p>
<p>It's a bit like being on your knees, face down in a pool of water, running out of breath and not recognizing that you can just put your hands down to lift your head up to take a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Talks like Cabel's help a lot. I'm far from alone in my efforts - but it helps to see others who have been through the fire and are still standing.</p>
