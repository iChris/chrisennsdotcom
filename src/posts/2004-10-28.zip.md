<p>Anyone out there tried/using <a href="http://www.zip.ca">zip.ca</a>?  It doesn't seem like that bad a deal.  Basically commiting to paying $25/month for movie rentals - which I know most of us do that anyway with it being almost $6 each time at the local Blockbuster or whatever.  Just curious if there's anyone with any actual experience with how well it works.</p>
