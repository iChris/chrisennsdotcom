<p>I'm sure that the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0015T963C?ie=UTF8&tag=farawsoclose-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0015T963C">Kindle</a> and the forthcoming <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/ipad/">iPad</a> are great advancements in digital e-reader technology, but I'm still reluctant to give up reading an actual book:</p>
<blockquote><p>A chief virtue of digital books is said to be their economical size—they take up no space at all!—but even a megabyte seems bulky compared to what can be conveyed in the few cubic feet of a bookshelf. What other vessel is able to hold with such precision, intricacy, and economy, all the facets of your life: that you bake bread, vacationed in China, fetishize Melville, aspire to read Shakespeare, have coped with loss, and still tote around a copy of The Missing Piece as a totem of your childhood. And what by contrast can a Kindle tell you about yourself or say to those who visit your house? All it offers is blithe reassurance that there is progress in the world, and that you are a part of it.</p></blockquote>
