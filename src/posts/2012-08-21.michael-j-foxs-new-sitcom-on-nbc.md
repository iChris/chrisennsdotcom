<blockquote><p>
  Fox is trying to find a home for a single-camera sitcom based on his own life. He's teaming up with Sam Laybourne (writer of Arrested Development and Cougar Town) and Will Gluck (director of Easy A), and surprise! The networks are very interested.

<p>Looks like <a href="http://www.vulture.com/2012/08/nbc-lands-michael-j-fox-sitcom-in-giant-deal.html">NBC won the bidding war</a>.</p>
<p>As long as there's room for cameos from the Family Ties cast, I'm in.</p>
