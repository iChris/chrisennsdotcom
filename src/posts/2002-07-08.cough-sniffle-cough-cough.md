<p>So the lake didn't happen - well the lake I'm sure was there, it just didn't happen for us. Sue came down with a cold friday night that meant we spent the weekend getting better. Actually she spent the weekend getting better, I spent the weekend feeding my Sims addicition. (Mark got married to Carlo's girlfriend, appropriately named 'girlfriend' because I couldn't remember her name - sorry c-lo!)</p>
<p>After i manged to kick the Sims habit for awhile, Travis came over and we did some recording of a tune he's had floating around his head for awhile. Click here for a sample of it.</p>
<p>Have a great Monday!</p>
