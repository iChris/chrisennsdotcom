<p>John Gruber <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2011/11/fun_with_numbers">wrote an interesting article</a> on how the NPD Group<sup id="fnref-19827:1"><a href="#fn-19827:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> <a href="https://www.npd.com/wps/portal/npd/us/news/pressreleases/pr_111122b">goes out of their way</a> to make the PC tablet industry sound like it's doing just fine - so long as you turn a blind eye to the pummeling the iPad is inflicting on the rest of the industry. The numbers are from January through to October, 2011.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  "According to NPD's Consumer Tracking Service, 76 percent of consumers who purchased a non-Apple tablet didn't even consider the iPad..."
</p></blockquote>
<p>So 3/4 of the people who didn't buy an iPad, didn't consider buying an iPad. Shocking, right?</p>
<p>Using a fairly safe estimate of 10,000,000 iPads sold, John is able to guess that nearly 90% of tablet sales were iPads.</p>
<p>So 10% of the tablets sold went to 5 other companies.<sup id="fnref-19827:2"><a href="#fn-19827:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>
<p>Or as <a href="https://twitter.com/jsnell/status/139517109439959040">Jason Snell tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If I'm reading it right, it suggests 92% of tablet buyers considered iPad and 89% bought iPad. That's... not a good sign for competitors.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Time to figure out a way to buy some Apple stock.</p>

One of those companies was HP, who had a $99 fire-sale on their tablet attempt.&#160;<a href="#fnref-19827:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
