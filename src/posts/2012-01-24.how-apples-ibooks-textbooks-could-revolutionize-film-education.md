title: "How Apple's iBooks Textbooks Could Revolutionize Film Education"

<p>More <a href="http://www.candlerblog.com/2012/01/20/ibooks-author/">thoughts on iBooks Textbooks</a> as people start to grapple with what this means for various industries:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If a book could embed not only videos, but exercises on how to apply these high-level filmmaking ideas, it would cut through some of the toughest stumbling blocks of learning cinema. Imagine being able to read about the 180-degree rule, then seeing it play out in a scene. Then you could even be given a group of shots to quickly assemble into a scene right on your iPad. It’s a very different process than sitting through clips in a classroom, then firing up an editing application and getting started on a test project.
