<p>Alright, last one I promise. Maybe. I've still got an Instapaper queue full of articles and memories on Steve to go through someday so I shouldn't really promise that.</p>
<p>Apple has updated the <a href="http://www.apple.com/stevejobs/">www.apple.com/stevejobs/</a> page to be a continually updating flow of memories and thanks that people have emailed in.</p>
