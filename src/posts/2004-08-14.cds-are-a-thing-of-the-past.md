<p>I finally did it.  I got rid of all my jewel cases for my CD's.  We bought 2 120 CD  binders - but it wasn't quite enough.  Ugh.  It took me almost 4 hrs to go through and pull the CD's out (along with whatever insert would fit) and put them in and I still didn't finish completely.  There's about 30 more CD's to go that will have to go in another binder.</p>
<p>On the one hand it was really good to get rid of 2 garbage bags worth of jewel cases that had been taking up space in our place - but on the other hand that's a lot of CDs that I don't really listen to.  I've ripped anything that I might even possible listen to into iTunes - that gave me 2709 songs, or 7.9 days worth of music played back to back, or 12.98GB of music encoded in AAC at 160kbps - but there's still a lot of CD's that I probably won't ever pull out to play.</p>
<p>I went out with Mark to the Yard last night for cheap beer and an ok chicken caesar wrap.  I still haven't found a replacement for the Odeon's wrap that seemed to lift up my day and light up my night.  Anyway.  Trav bought the Megaman collection so we hit that up for a bit in a Megaman 2 kinda way.  I wonder how many hours have been spent on games like that - where you play the original when you're a kid, and then play it all over again when they come out with a 'retro' version that you pick up as an adult?</p>
