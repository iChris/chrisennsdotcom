<p>The iOS Google+ app has been <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2012/07/google-app-for-ipad-available-now-in.html">updated with a iPad option</a>, as well as being updated with these features:</p>
<ul>
<li>We recently launched Events on Google+, and now you can create and manage them right from your iPhone. Post a comment, upload a photo or check out who’s going. Your past event invitations are saved with all the photos and posts shared by your friends, so you can relive the party anytime you want.</li>
<li>Start a Hangout from anywhere</li>
<li>Start a Hangout from your iPad and stream it to your TV using AirPlay</li>
</ul>

<p>I really love the tech and design of Google+ - but I'm not willing to try and convert anyone to use it just yet. And that's perhaps the biggest problem facing Google. People will try and convince friends/family to join Twitter or Facebook. Google+ is still a 'meh' for most folks. You can <a href="https://plus.google.com/118123290386382463789/">circle me on Google+ if you like</a> - but for right now it's mostly links to blog posts here and the occasional attempt at Hangouts.</p>
