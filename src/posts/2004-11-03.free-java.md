<p>My Tim Horton's rep (aka the lady who remembers what I always get every morning) gave me a free lg english toffee today.  That made my day after a crappy night of helping a guy figure out how to get pictures off his digital camera that just doesn't really want to function properly with WinME.</p>
<p>I think I'm going to switch to being strictly a Mac support.  Stupid Windows.</p>
