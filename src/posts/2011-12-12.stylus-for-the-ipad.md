<p>There's a famous quote from Steve Jobs about shipping a stylus<sup id="fnref-19887:1"><a href="#fn-19887:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> with an iPad:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It's like we said on the iPad, if you see a stylus, they blew it. In multitasking, if you see a task manager... they blew it. Users shouldn't ever have to think about it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Which is why I doubt you'll see a stylus ever ship with an iPad. It's another <em>thing</em> you'd have to manage and remember to bring with you to use your iPad and that's definitely not the Apple way.</p>
<p>That said, there's some apps that clearly would be made better with some other form of input than your fingertip and there's a lot of different stylus options 3rd party companies have produced.</p>

<p>But if you're going to buy one iPad stylus, you should buy the <a href="http://www.studioneat.com/products/cosmonaut">Cosmonaut from Studio Neat</a>. It sells for $25 + $7 for shipping international. You can <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/12/12/the-cosmonaut-stylus-review">read Marco's review of the Cosmonaut</a> if you need more convincing (<em>Spoiler: He loves it.</em>)</p>
<p>Studio Neat is the same guys that made the sweet <a href="http://www.studioneat.com/pages/glifoptions">Glif iPhone adapter</a> that allows you to mount your iPhone on any standard camera mount. I have one and it works great, particularly if you want to use your iPhone for any video recording. Pick up the Glif and the Cosmonaut and you'll get free shipping.</p>
<p>While you're waiting for your order, check out <a href="http://vimeo.com/33174125">the video detailing how the Cosmonaut is made featuring with an introduction by Mr. Rogers</a>.</p>
