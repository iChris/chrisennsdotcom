<p>Damien's been getting lots of great family time with Sue's family.  His cousin, Samuel (seen below sitting in a funky new chair), is in town and they've been getting on great.  Lots of time spent crusing around, checking out the ladies, getting their diapers changed, the usual thing cousins do when they see each other for the first time.</p>

<p>We're all headed up to Elk Ridge for the week to hang out, relax, and change lots of diapers.  Can't wait!</p>
