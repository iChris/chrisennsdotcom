<p>Editorial for iPad (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/editorial/id673907758&at=10l4Ki">$4.99 in the App Store</a>, <a href="http://omz-software.com/editorial/">website</a>) is a new writing, editing and coding app for the iPad that looks really powerful. If I had an iPad I'd be picking up a copy right now.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Editorial is a plain text editor for the iPad with powerful automation tools and a beautiful inline preview for writing Markdown.</p>
<p>  You can combine a large selection of simple text processing actions into your very own workflows — all in an intuitive drag'n'drop interface that makes it easy to see what's happening — even if things get complex.</p>
<p>  And if that's not enough, you have a full-fledged Python interpreter at your fingertips, including modules for easily accessing the editor's text, the iOS clipboard, or even your photo library. Editorial is the first fully-scriptable writing app on iOS.

<blockquote><p>
  When I’m on my Mac, I miss Editorial’s automation and editing features.
</p></blockquote>
<p>which is an interesting thought since most people assume it works the other way. When you're on a smaller, less featured device like an iPad or iPhone you'll miss features, not the other way around. <a href="http://www.macstories.net/stories/editorial-for-ipad-review/">Check out Federico's full review of Editorial for iPad</a> - written on Editorial for iPad.

<p>I'm excited to see where iOS apps are going and Editorial for iPad is a great landmark app of what's possible on iOS in 2013.</p>
