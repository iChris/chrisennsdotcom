<p><a href="https://chrisenns.com/2010/06/04/carcassonne-on-iphoneipod-touch/">Carcassonne</a> is still getting a lot of use as my wife and I keep a game going back and forth (the number 1 means it's my turn).  Aside from that, I use <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/tumblr/id305343404?mt=8">Tumblr</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/twitter/id333903271?mt=8">Twitter</a>, <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/reeder/id325502379?mt=8">Reeder</a> and <a href="http://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/simplenote/id289429962?mt=8">Simplenote</a> the most.</p>

There's a new iPad app, <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fintro-to-math-by-montessorium%252Fid381064973%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Intro to Math, by Montessorium</a> that looks like it could be a good educational app to distract him with on long car rides.</p>
