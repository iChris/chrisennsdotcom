title: "You Are Boring"
---
<p>Possibly related to the previous post, Scott Simpson's <a href="http://yourmonkeycalled.com/post/44174487350/you-are-boring">article for The Magazine is now available</a> and it's a good one:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The people who were interesting told good stories. They were also inquisitive: willing to work to expand their social and intellectual range. Most important, interesting people were also the best listeners. They knew when to ask questions. This was the set of people whose shows I would subscribe to, whose writing I would seek out, and whose friendship I would crave. In other words, those people were the opposite of boring.

<p>I need to apologize to Scott for making him listen to some of my <a href="http://ssktn.com">podcasts</a> that I've submitted over the years. Luckily for him he no longer works at Apple and is free from any new podcasts I submit.</p>
