<p>Two apps that will no doubt be on upcoming episodes of <a href="http://ssktn.com/shows/appsession/">Appsession</a>.</p>
<p>The first is a new Twitter client from <a href="http://tapbots.com/">Tapbots</a> called <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ftweetbot-a-twitter-client%252Fid428851691%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Tweetbot</a> (<em>$1.99, affiliate link</em>) that is a lot of fun to use. I'm only using it on the <a href="http://www.twitter.com/ssktn">@ssktn</a> account to toot about new episodes. Certainly good to have an alternative to the official Twitter client.</p>

<p>The second is an SSH client (non-nerds can tune out at this point) called <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fprompt%252Fid421507115%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Prompt</a> (<em>$4.99, affiliate link</em>) from <a href="http://panic.com/">Panic</a>. I haven't used this one yet, but knowing the level of craftsmanship they put into their other applications (<a href="http://panic.com/transmit/">Transmit</a> is the only FTP client you need) I have no doubt Prompt is going to be the best SSH client on an iOS device. Great that they include both the iPhone/iPod touch and iPad version in the same app.</p>
