<p>Mark it on your calendar as <a href="http://www.loopinsight.com/2012/07/30/apples-rumored-september-12-event/">confirmed by Jim Dalrymple</a>.</p>
<p>Rumours of what's to be announced can be found at <a href="http://www.imore.com/apple-iphone-5-and-ipad-mini-event-planned-september-12-iphone-5-release-date-september-21">imore.com</a>, &amp; <a href="http://allthingsd.com/20120730/apple-stocks-up-on-components-for-fall-product-launch/">allthingsd.com</a> among others places, but the gist of it is:</p>
<ul>
<li>New iPhone (the name will just be iPhone, just like the iPad)</li>
<li>iPad mini</li>
<li>iPod touch refresh</li>
<li>iPod nano refresh</li>
<li>Smaller dock connector</li>
</ul>
<p>So if someone asks you if they should buy a iPhone 4/4S between now and September 12th, you can send them here and say to wait until September.</p>
