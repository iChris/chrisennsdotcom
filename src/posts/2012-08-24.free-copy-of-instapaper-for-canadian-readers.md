title: "Free Copy of Instapaper for Canadian Readers"
---
<p>First come, first serve. I found these in my laptop bag and thought I'd offer them as a giveaway here on my blog.</p>
<p>These expire August 28th, 2012 - though I assume someone will use them before then. I think they're only available to Canadians. If they don't work for you, chances are someone else typed faster than you did. Sorry!</p>

<h3>Too Late?</h3>
<p>If you're too late for the free copies of Instapaper, I'd still recommend <a href="http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Finstapaper%252Fid288545208%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">picking it up for only $2.99 in the App Store</a> if you haven't already. I use Instapaper every day to read articles from various blogs and websites.</p>
