<p>Somehow in getting SSH to work, I've broken HTTP.  Grrrr.  Logically it's something I did but I've retraced my steps and as far as I know the only thing I've changed is the hosts.allow and hosts.deny files - which if I put them back to the way they were (as Carlos was helpful enough to do yesterday), locks me out of SSH again.</p>
<p>I'm sure this is all very enlightening to the non-tech geeks out there.  But you'll just have to suffer through it or go read another blog.  :)  It's a challenge that has been laid in front of me by Linux and I can't give in and admit defeat.</p>
