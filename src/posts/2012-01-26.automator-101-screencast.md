<p>Here's a quick screencast I did of how Automator works at a basic level.</p>
<p>Nothing too fancy in this video, just renaming 7 files that could probably have been done manually but I thought I'd use the opportunity to show how Automator works and help you see how you might be able to use this app that's built-in to OS X to save some time.</p>
<p>I was writing a <a href="http://www.lemonproductions.ca/2012/01/got-a-band-need-a-website-for-your-band/">blog post on Lemon Productions</a> and wanted to include some screenshots of the WordPress theme I was talking about and... well, I don't want to spoil the ending. Just watch the video. It's pretty intense.<sup id="fnref-20013:1"><a href="#fn-20013:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
