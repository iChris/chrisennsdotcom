title: "In My Day - Like, Whatever"

<p>Great article from a fellow crusty fellow who remembers the good old days of creating content on the internet when you had to do a little bit more than simply <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/register">have an email address and be able to think of a password</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>Maybe it’s just too easy to like something these days. I’ve had people with Twitter followers in the millions kindly link to my blog and the result has been anywhere from a handful to a several hundred new visitors. That’s a pretty small click-through rate. In the past, people who wanted to share content usually did so on a blog. They had to create a blog, build a following, and maybe learn a little html. It took some commitment and effort to share. It was an active choice as opposed to a knee-jerk reaction. And from that time until now, I find that the number of visits from even a lightly trafficked blog is markedly higher than many Facebook likes and Twitter retweets combined.</p></blockquote>
