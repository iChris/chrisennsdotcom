<p>I've added a few new things to the blog (<a href="http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/macblog/">the mac blog</a> makes a re-appearance) among which is a radio.blog music player.  It's flash based and basically allows me to throw up a bunch of tunes I'm diggin and you can listen... or not.  They're in flash format so it's not like you can go grab the MP3 and steal it.</p>
<p>I'll be adding tracks to it shortly.</p>
