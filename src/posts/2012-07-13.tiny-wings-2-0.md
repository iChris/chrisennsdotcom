Perk of buying it on the App Store - version 2 included for free for anyone who had purchased version one.</p>

<p>There's also a new iPad version called Tiny Wings HD, <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ftiny-wings-hd%252Fid541517597%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">$2.99 in the App Store</a>, that would look great on a new Retina iPad.</p>
<p>But it's important to not over think these games. :)</p>
