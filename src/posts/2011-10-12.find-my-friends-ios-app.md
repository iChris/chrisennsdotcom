<p>Apple released another new app today, <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Ffind-my-friends%252Fid466122094%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Find My Friends</a> (also requires iOS5), that allows you to selectively turn on the location/GPS and allow people to see where you are - or you to see where they are.</p>
<p>It's the perfect app for those concerned about sharing their every move on other sites like <a href="http://gowalla.com/">Gowalla</a>, Facebook and Foursquare where everything is wide open unless you turn on the security settings.</p>
<p>You can do things such as set a temporary time that your location is available to certain people, as seen in the screenshot below:</p>

<p>So if you're at a conference or a family vacation at Disneyland, you could allow everyone you know to see where you are so you can more easily meet up and find each other.</p>
<p>As I said on a recent episode of <a href="http://ssktn.com/podcasts/tltb/001-too-lazy-to-blog-lets-talk-iphone/">Too Lazy to Blog</a>, it's one of those features that sounds really good when talked up - but most people probably won't use it that often.</p>
