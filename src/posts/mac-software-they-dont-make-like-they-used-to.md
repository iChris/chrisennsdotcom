My parents recently had to buy a new washing machine because theirs broke. Repairing it was going to cost them almost as much as a new one. My dad said:

> ...a sales guy at the store told me when we were buying our new unit "These days if you can get 10 years out of your home appliances, you're lucky. They sure don't make them like they used to." We were at year 13 on ours. I guess we got a lucky one.

We recently bought a house that's just over 10 years old, with the appliances that would all also be around 10 years old. I really hope we got some lucky ones.

My parent's experience got me thinking about software on my computer that I've depended on for years that recently stopped working.

First, this is what they're supposed to do.

### Backblaze

[Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/cloud-backup.html#af2307) is software that runs on your computer and quietly backs up your entire computer to their cloud storage. My entire [business](https://lemonproductions.ca) is on my computer. I can't afford to not have an offsite backup. [Time Machine](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201250) is great - especially because it's built in to every Mac - but it's in the same physical location as my computer. Not great if some sort of catastrophic failure (theft, fire, etc.) happened.

### TextExpander

[TextExpander](https://textexpander.com/) is a tool I use so frequently that I often forget that it's not built in to every Mac like Time Machine. It sort of is - [create keyboard shortcuts on the Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlp2271/mac) - but it's not as elegant as TextExpander. TextExpander allows me to to type specific keys and then will "expand" that into something I've set up. 

For example, I have a live stream link I use for Twitch. Rather than type out the URL each time, I just type the letters `llive` and then instantly TextExpander recognizes that combination of characters and deletes them and replaces them with the full URL: https://www.lemonproductions.ca/live. It works great! When it works.

## What's Not Working

Lately both of these apps are failing for no apparent reason other than possibly updates to the macOS that have broken the way they work. As far as I can tell, it's nothing I've done. But I'd be more than happy
