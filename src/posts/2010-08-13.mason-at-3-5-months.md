title: "Mason at 3.5 Months"
---
<p>We'll have to sort out a new system here since obviously we can't just post about Damien anymore, but in the meantime, here's a quick little video of Mason at 3.5 months:</p>
<p><a href="http://vimeo.com/13635856">Direct link to video</a></p>
<p>For a bit of reference, <a href="http://www.mennoboy.com/damien/2007/10/19/damien-pics-and-his-first-video/">here's some pics of Damien at around the same age</a>.  The video linked there isn't on the internets anymore (we have it on our computer somewhere).  <a href="http://vimeo.com/401111">Here's a video of Damien at 5 months</a>, which is where Mason is actually right now.  Good to see the spastic flailing of arms that Mason has started to do runs in the family (and babies at that age.)  :)</p>
