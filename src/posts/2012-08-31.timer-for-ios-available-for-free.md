<h3>Quick Review of Timer</h3>
<p>Timer is such a great idea for a timing app. It allows you to set up to 12 separate timers, each with their own length and notification sound. And even better - once a specific timer runs out and it has alerted you, it starts flashing and counting back up. So if you forget to go check on whatever it was you were supposed to do when the timer ran out you'll know how long it's actually been.</p>
<p>So smart.</p>
