<p>A new version of my favourite iOS app for listening to podcasts, <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Finstacast%252Fid420368235%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Instacast v2.0 has been released and the price has been dropped to $0.99</a> with an in-app $1.99 purchasing option to upgrade to pro features.</p>
<p>Worlds better than the built in iPod/music player for listening to podcasts - an easy recommendation to anyone listening to any <a href="http://ssktn.com">podcasts</a> on the go. <a href="http://vemedio.com/products/instacast">Check out the product page for more details</a> on what's new.</p>
