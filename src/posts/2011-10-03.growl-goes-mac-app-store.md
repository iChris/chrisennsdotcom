<p>Growl, the popular system notification system, has <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fgrowl%252Fid467939042%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">gone to the Mac App Store for it's latest version</a>.</p>
<p>Growl is commonly used by applications within Mac OS X to notify you of tasks being completed - i.e. when you're uploading a large file to a server and you switch away to do something else and don't want to have to constantly check to see if it's done, Growl will pop up a little window to let you know the file is done.</p>

<p>It's not one of those apps that's critical to day to day use of a Mac, but you sure miss it once it's gone. And it looks like for support in Lion, it'll be a must purchase for most previous users.</p>
<p>At $1.99 it's no longer the <strong>free</strong> system notification system it used to be. But hopefully with real money behind it's development it will only get better.</p>
