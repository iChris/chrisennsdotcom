<p>Scanner Pro, an iOS app that allows you to "scan" paper into your iPhone or iPad, is <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/scanner-pro-by-readdle/id333710667?mt=8&uo=4&at=10l4Ki" target="itunes_store">currently free in the iTunes App Store</a> - down from it's regular price of $7.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Scanner Pro transforms your iPhone and iPad into portable scanners. It allows you to scan receipts, whiteboards, paper notes, or any multipage document.</p>
<p>  Scanned documents can be emailed and printed, uploaded to Dropbox, Google Drive and Evernote, or simply saved on the iPhone/iPad.</p>
<p>  The application incorporates special algorithms that remove shadows, make scans sharper, correct perspective and make them as readable as possible.

<p>I already use Evernote for this type of collection of documents and receipts so I'll have to see how Scanner Pro might fit into my workflow. I suspect the main use will be combining multi-page documents into a single document.</p>
