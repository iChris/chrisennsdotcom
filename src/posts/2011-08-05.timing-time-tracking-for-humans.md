<p>One of the things I need to do as a web developer is track the amount of time I spend on a given project. Typically I do this by keeping a text file open throughout the day that I make a note of what time I start on a task or project and what time I end. It works well for me because I'm a bit anal about keeping track of things like this - but I know there are times when I've forgotten.</p>

Timing is a Mac App that constantly runs in your menu bar and tracks the amount of time you spend using anything and everything you use on your Mac. And when I say everything - it is literally everything. Not just the app you're using, but what particular aspect of that app you're using.</p>
<p>For example, within Safari you can drill down and see what web pages you have open and how long you spent on each web page:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/timing-screenshot.png" alt="Timing Screenshot" title="timing-screenshot" width="588" height="389" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-19634" /></p>
<p>You can see that I spent 7 minutes in Safari, the majority of which was at my blog while writing this entry. Over time, I can tell how much time I've spent writing at my blog and more easily tell whether it's worth my time and energy to write here. [ref]Disregarding the fact that I enjoy the writing, however much time I spend doing it.[/ref]</p>
<p>I'm not looking forward to seeing how often I've checked the Twitter app.</p>
