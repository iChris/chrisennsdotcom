title: "No Pixar Film In 2014"
---
<p>Pixar has decided to delay The Good Dinosaur's release, their next film project, until 2015 meaning 2014 will be the first time in 8 years that there isn't a Pixar film in the theatres.</p>
<p><a href="http://pixartimes.com/2013/09/18/the-good-dinosaur-pushed-to-2015-no-pixar-film-in-2014/">From Pixar Times:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>
  Since 2006, it has been a given that we would see a Pixar film released during the summer season every year. The first indication that this streak was at risk of ending arrived with the news that The Good Dinosaur director <a href="http://pixartimes.com/2013/08/30/confirmed-the-good-dinosaur-switches-out-director-bob-peterson/">Bob Peterson had been taken off the project</a>. The film, which was scheduled to arrive in May 2014, was taken over by a collection of Pixar veterans such as John Lasseter and Toy Story 3 director Lee Unkrich, but no replacement director was named. For an animated film that was less than one year away, it signaled significant trouble.

<p>Quality over quantity is a great thing to say when you're talking about small projects - but Pixar would generate hundreds of millions of dollars just putting out a film, period.</p>
<p>Bumping The Good Dinosaur back a year means the Finding Nemo sequel <a href="http://pixartimes.com/category/news/finding-dory/">Finding Dory</a> is now pushed into the summer of 2016.</p>
<p>Hope somebody told <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_JJmDavBXrw">Ellen Degeneres</a>.</p>
