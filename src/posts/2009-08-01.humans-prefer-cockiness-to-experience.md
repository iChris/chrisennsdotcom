<p>From a <a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227115.500-humans-prefer-cockiness-to-expertise.html">article at NewScientist.com</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>The research, by Don Moore of Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, shows that we prefer advice from a confident source, even to the point that we are willing to forgive a poor track record. Moore argues that in competitive situations, this can drive those offering advice to increasingly exaggerate how sure they are.</p></blockquote>
<p>I've found this to be completely true in my experience doing sales as well as when giving advice to people on tech related stuff.  People who I know, or at least think <em>should</em> trust me more will go with someone else who appears more confident.  I routinely try and give both sides of an issue when someone is asking my opinion - but that, in effect, gives the impression that I'm not really sure what I'm talking about.</p>
<p>Obviously the same is true of television commercials and advertising.  You wouldn't trust someone trying to sell you toothpaste if they said that 4 out of 5 dentists were pretty sure it worked well.</p>
<p>It's frustrating at times, but I'm not willing to become Mr. Douchey Loudmouth to win people's trust.  Their loss, not mine.  :)</p>
