title: "Saskatchewan to Get an Apple Store?"
---
<p>It's not confirmed by Apple yet, but <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2012/05/01/upcoming-saskatchewan-apple-retail-store-fills-huge-void-in-coverage/">rumour has it that Regina will be getting Saskatchewan's first Apple store</a>.</p>
<p>I don't know if things have changed since I worked in retail, but back then Apple had little to no support presence in Saskatchewan - sales and tech support was based out of Winnipeg or Alberta.</p>
<p>It sucks that they chose Regina though. Saskatoon would make a much better spot for an Apple store, but then I'm a little biased.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> Looks like, if <a href="https://twitter.com/himpster/status/197382468586848257">@himpster / @jackleCBC</a> are right, that it's just an Apple reseller not an official Apple store.</p>
