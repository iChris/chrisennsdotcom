<p>Found this via boing-boing:</p>
<p>Here's a <a href="http://blogs.magnatune.com/buckman/">blog</a> by a guy who's attempting to run his own label that's done under a Creative Commons license so that, in a sense, it's open source music I guess?  Interesting article on world musicians who sign their life over to record producers/labels and thus see no money from their recordings.  This makes him not-evil.</p>
