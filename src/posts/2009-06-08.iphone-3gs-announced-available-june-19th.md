<p>The big announcement from Apple today is the June 19th release of the newest iPhone, the iPhone 3GS.  All sorts of updates (<a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/iphone/iphone-3g-s/">read more here</a>) but the nicest feature, next to the speed increase, IMHO is the video camera along with video editing software right on the phone.</p>
<blockquote><p>Now you can shoot video, edit it, and share it — all on your iPhone 3G S. Shoot high-quality VGA video in portrait or landscape. Trim your footage by adjusting start and end points. Then share your video in an email, post it to your MobileMe gallery, publish it on YouTube, or sync it back to your Mac or PC using iTunes.</p></blockquote>
<p>The camera is a not-to-shabby 3 megapixel which has a very nifty tap focus:</p>
<blockquote><p>The new 3-megapixel camera takes great still photos, too, thanks to built-in autofocus and a handy new feature that lets you tap the display to focus on anything (or anyone) you want.</p></blockquote>
<p>The current iPhone 3G is dropping to $99 with the new model taking it's place at $199.</p>
<p><strong><em>Update</em>: Keith McArthur from Rogers <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2009/06/08/iphone-3gs-announced-available-june-19th/#comment-5666">left a comment</a> below with firm details from Rogers on pricing and availability.  Thanks Keith!</strong></p>
<p>We'll see when/if Rogers Canada actually hits the June 19th release date.  I'm skeptical but I'd love for them to prove me wrong.  <a href="http://www.rogers.com/web/Rogers.portal">Rogers website</a> still doesn't mention anything on there about the new iPhone.  I picture their web developers wondering why they're getting so many hits today and scratching their heads.</p>
