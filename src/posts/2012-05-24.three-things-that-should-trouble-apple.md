title: "Three Things That Should Trouble Apple"
---
<p>I really like the premise for Guy English's<sup id="fnref-20440:1"><a href="#fn-20440:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> article, <a href="http://kickingbear.com/blog/archives/305">Three Things That Should Trouble Apple</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I believe that many Apple observers have been too invested in picking off the low hanging fruit of obviously out-of-touch commentators, columnists, and analysts. Apple is winning. It’s fun to pick on the idiots, and we do tune in for the affirmation that engenders, but that’s not insight. It’s a tag team wedgie patrol. It takes a cleaver intellect to dismantle bullshit but, ultimately, it often just ends up with pantsing the dumb guy. Rather than doing that let’s aim to pants the A-grade quarterback.

<p>Take the high road and point the lens back on the Mac and figure out what needs improving. Good stuff.</p>
