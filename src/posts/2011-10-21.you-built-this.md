<p>Anthony Stauffer, co-host of <a href="http://ssktn.com/shows/the-google-juice/">The Google Juice</a>, the longest running (that's not currently running) podcast about anti-internet marketing, is celebrating 4 years of running his online guitar training website <a href="http://www.steviesnacks.com">Steviesnacks.com</a>. 2 years ago he was able to quit his job and take it full-time. I consider the way he's built his business to be the model for how to keep your integrity intact while providing for your family through your passions and interests.</p>
<p>I first came across Anthony via the excellent tech/gear/how to podcast he did with Dan Benjamin called <a href="http://5by5.tv/mixdown">The Mixdown</a>. Anthony's clearly a teacher at heart and his explanations of mic mechanics, audio software, compression, distortion and other topics gave what I'm attempting to do over at <a href="http://ssktn.com">SSKTN.com</a> a huge leap forward and it's not over stating things to say that I wouldn't be where I'm at with SSKTN if I hadn't stumbled across The Mixdown and Anthony Stauffer.</p>
<p>When he agreed to be a guest on my interview show, <a href="http://ssktn.com/podcasts/welcometotheinternet/008-welcome-to-the-internet-anthony-stauffer/">Welcome to the Internet</a>, I was shocked that he'd take the time to chat about his business with me - some random dude from Canada. But talk he did and it has since become the most downloaded episode I've recorded to date on <a href="http://ssktn.com">SSKTN.com</a>.</p>
<p>Anthony wrote a great article <a href="http://www.steviesnacks.com/blog/2011/10/21/4-years-you-built-this.html">thanking all the people who helped him build Steviesnack.com</a>.</p>
<p>Congratulations Anthony on 4 years of sweet guitar tones and melting people's faces off.</p>
<p><em>I'm sure the inclusion of my name on his list of thanks was an administrative error and will be remedied shortly.</em></p>
