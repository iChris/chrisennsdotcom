<p>From the NPR  Health Blog, <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2010/08/30/129531631/5-worries-parents-should-drop-and-5-they-should">5 Worries Parents Should Drop, and 5 They Shouldn't</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>That’s the sound of helicopter parents hovering over their children, worrying every second of the day that terrorists could strike Johnny's school or a stranger will snatch Jane from the bus stop.</p></blockquote>
<p>Based on a survey, the top 5 worries of parents (presumably US based) are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Kidnapping</li>
<li>School snipers</li>
<li>Terrorists</li>
<li>Dangerous strangers</li>
<li>Drugs</li>
</ol>
<p>And how do children actually get hurt/killed?</p>
<ol>
<li>Car accidents</li>
<li>Homicide (usually committed by a person who knows the child, not a stranger)</li>
<li>Abuse</li>
<li>Suicide</li>
<li>Drowning</li>
</ol>
<p>So that either puts your mind at ease or gives you even more things to worry about that you hadn't thought of yet.</p>
