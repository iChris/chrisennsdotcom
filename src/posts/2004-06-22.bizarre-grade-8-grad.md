<p>Sue and I went to a grad last night for a bunch of the grade 8's that go to the Junior High group at FGCC.  Some funny stuff while they were introducing each other.  A lot of them hoped to get a good paying job, have a family, and marry a hot chick/Johnny Depp (it's a wonder what putting on a little makeup and acting like a drunk/gay pirate will do for your stock with the ladies).  The funniest thing was the songs they chose to sing: In My Life by the Beatles, Lean On Me and It's My Life by Bon Jovi!?!?  Hilarious.  And apparently they used that same song two years ago at the same school.  Someone there has a serious hankering for Jon Bon.</p>
