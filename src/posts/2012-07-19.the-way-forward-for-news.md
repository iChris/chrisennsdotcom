title: "The Way Forward for News?"

<p><a href="http://evening-edition.com/">The Evening Edition</a> is a news website published daily during the week at 5pm Pacific time. The site was developed by <a href="http://muledesign.com/">Mule Design</a> who typically do client web work but as <a href="http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/these-designers-did-for-fun-what-news-sites-cant-do-to-save-their-business.php">this write up on ReadWriteWeb.com details</a>, they're doing for fun what news sites can't do to save themselves.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Evening Edition brings you today’s world news without push notifications. It has no streams or feeds. It doesn’t do [BREAKING] or [UPDATING]. It’s delivered by website to your device of choice every weekday at 5 p.m., and it’s just the right amount of reading for the subway ride from office to home.

<p>The way forward perhaps? There's something in this that could work for a variety of subjects or niche topics. Almost like if I held all my posts for a day in draft mode and then published them at 5pm.</p>
