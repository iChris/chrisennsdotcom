<p>Great news for Netflix. Hopefully it'll be good for Canadian Netflix subscribers as well. The only catch is that the really good stuff from the Disney vaults doesn't arrive until 2016:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  You’ll have to wait awhile to stream your favorite Disney films, though. The company’s backlog, which includes the animated Pixar library and Star Wars franchise, will be available on Netflix beginning toward the end of 2016, after Disney’s current deal with pay-TV network Starz expires.
