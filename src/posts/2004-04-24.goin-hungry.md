<p>Thanks to everyone who sponsored us!  We're in the homestretch now - 9 more hours to go.  The apple juice is getting a little stale but I think we'll make it.  :)</p>
<p>Off to clean dorms at Bethany and collect food for the food bank before we have our "feast" (aka subs - don't try feeding 40 kids pizza after they haven't eaten for 30 hours... it'll shoot right through them!) at 7 tonight.</p>
<p>Darren's having a 1031 party tonight - so if you've ever been connected to 1031 Osler in any way, stop by there tonight and say goodbye to 1031.</p>
