<p>There's a lot of <a href="http://www.macrumors.com/2010/09/03/steve-jobs-defends-new-itunes-10-icon-against-criticism/">criticism from design nerds</a> over Apple's new icon for <a href="http://www.apple.com/itunes/">iTunes 10</a>:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/itunes10logo.jpg" alt="" title="iTunes 10 Logo" width="229" height="229" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14059" /></p>
<p>While flipping through the Walmart flyer this weekend, I noticed this:</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/walmartspecial.jpg" alt="" title="Walmart Special Icon" width="291" height="229" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-14060" /></p>
<p>Maybe Apple just wanted to remind people of the great deals on the iTunes store by associating with Walmart?</p>
