<p>Living in Canada, I didn't expect that much of the fun stuff Apple was doing on the Apple TV would be available here for awhile - if ever. And I'm hopefully not going to be buying a new TV anytime soon. But it's still disappointing to learn via <a href="http://joe-steel.com/2016-10-28-Apples-October-TV-Surprise.html">Joe Steel's recap of Apple's October event</a> how far behind and overpriced the Apple TV really is compared to other streaming boxes:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  There is no way to justify spending $150 to enter Apple’s TV ecosystem in the fall of 2016 on hardware alone. When Google is making a streaming UHD HDR player that costs LESS than a replacement Siri Remote, there is a problem with the hardware Apple is selling.

<p>Our current 2nd-gen Apple TV is working fine other than the Netflix app rebooting the machine randomly. So if there was a compelling reason to upgrade to a new Apple TV, I certainly would do it.</p>
<p>But with most of the new features locked to the USA [footnote]Thanks Obama[/footnote] I think I might try out a <a href="https://www.google.com/intl/en_ca/chromecast/?utm_source=chromecast.com">Chromecast</a> the next time Netflix boots me out of a show.</p>
