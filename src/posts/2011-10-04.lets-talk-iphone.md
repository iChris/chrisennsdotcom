<p>At the risk of coming off like an Apple apologist - or <strong>more</strong> of an Apple apologist - people should remember that Apple has said nothing about what to expect from today's iPhone event. Apple hasn't said that they're going to talk about a new iPhone 5, an upgraded iPhone 4S or just a new version of the operating system.</p>
<p>Just that they're going to talk iPhone.</p>
<p>So when they don't show that they've cured cancer AND are offering everyone in North America (except for Canada) trips to walk on the moon, it's hard to blame Apple for that.</p>
<p>Granted, people have their own expectations of what they think Apple should announce in order to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remain competitive with another company, i.e. Google</li>
<li>Satisfy some internal checklist of reasons you're hoping to buy a new iPhone. i.e. I don't think I would've bought an iPhone 4 if it didn't have a decent video and still camera. That would've been a deal breaker for me.</li>
</ul>
<p>Apple's marketing is genius because they don't talk about what they hope to do down the road - they just build it and then talk about what they're shipping. </p>

<p>So yes, you can certainly be disappointed that Apple doesn't announce that they've found a way to create a live unicorn that can play chess. But it's not because Apple "failed to live up to..." or "...<a href="http://www.pimpmysafari.com/items/finally-finally/">finally releases</a>..." or whatever headline a tech columnist at your local newspaper decides to write tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>Just about any other tech company would continue to sell the iPhone 4 and not put out anything new. The iPhone 4 is still the <a href="http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/09/06/iphone_4_remains_top_selling_us_smartphone_despite_growing_iphone_5_hype.html">top selling smartphone in the US</a>, 16 months from its release. The second highest selling smartphone? The iPhone 3GS.</p>
<p>Motorola sold the same phone, the RAZR, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_RAZR">for 4 years</a>. It was tremendously successful. And now Motorola's mobile phone division is <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2011/08/supercharging-android-google-to-acquire.html">owned by Google</a>. Some might view that as a success.</p>
<p>I'm pretty sure Apple has a different view of success.</p>
