<p>I've been beta testing this since they started publicly testing it and I love the user interface and how easy it is to use to build simple gradients. It's <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fgradient%252Fid481981128%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">now available in the Mac App Store for $4.99</a> which is a bit more than a casual user would spend but is a time saver for any web design/developer that's well worth it.</p>
<p>They also include a nifty tutorial on-screen the first time you launch the app:</p>

<p>Pick it up if, like me, you were disappointed in how Apple changed the DigitalColor.app.</p>
