  “<a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/you-are-so-loved-lawyer-describes-efforts-to-save-nathan-cirillo/article21274458/">When you are dying, you need to be told how loved you are</a>.”

<p>Yesterday an honour guard solider was <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/what-unfolded-during-the-attack-in-ottawa/article21229398/">killed in my country's capital city, Ottawa</a>.</p>
<p>The soldier's name was Nathan Cirillo. The name of the coward who shot him in the back while guarding <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_War_Memorial_(Canada)">The National War Memorial</a> is not worth repeating. The coward was later <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/sergeant-at-arms-who-reportedly-shot-suspect-hailed-as-hero-by-mps/article21237164/">killed by the sergeant-at-arms</a>.</p>
<p>It's so senseless and random. I don't understand how someone can make the choice to end another human being's life.</p>
