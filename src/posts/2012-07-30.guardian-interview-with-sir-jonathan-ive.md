<p>The quote you'll see <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/apple/9438662/Apple-design-chief-Our-goal-isnt-to-make-money.html">from the interview</a> will likely be this one:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “Our goal isn’t to make money. Our goal absolutely at Apple is not to make money. This may sound a little flippant but it’s the truth,” said the British designer, who is credited with shaping the iPad and iPhone.
</p></blockquote>
<p>But I prefer this thought when he was talking about when Apple was nearly dead and Steve Jobs was brought back in to help revive the company:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  “You would have thought that, when what stands between you and bankruptcy is some money, your focus would be on making some money, but that was not [Steve Jobs’] preoccupation.
</p></blockquote>
