<p>Even at <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?chdnp=0&amp;chdd=1&amp;chds=1&amp;chdv=1&amp;chvs=maximized&amp;chdeh=0&amp;chfdeh=0&amp;chdet=1329515199681&amp;chddm=1173.0000000000002&amp;chls=IntervalBasedLine&amp;q=NASDAQ:AAPL&amp;ntsp=0">$502 as of this post</a>, Apple's stock is still a bargain according to Slate.com:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Not only is Apple not peaking, it is likely not even close to reaching its potential earnings in its two biggest markets, smartphones and tablets. Indeed, I suspect that one of the reasons Apple’s share price is so low is that it has been difficult, on a purely perceptual level, for investors to understand the financial opportunities the company is poised to realize. The numbers are just too big; it simply doesn’t seem possible that a single company could capture such a large part of the market. But not only is it possible—it is happening. The iPhone accounts for only 9 percent of the market share in smartphones, but Apple is earning 75 percent of the profits in smartphones. Its dominance in the tablet market is even more staggering.

<p>Plenty of "I wish I woulda bought when $AAPL was at..." Time to get a group of friends together and buy a single share.</p>
