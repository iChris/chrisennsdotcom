title: "Keep Up With Comments on Podcasts or Apps"
---
<p>If you happen to publish <a href="http://ssktn.com">podcasts on the iTunes podcast listing</a> or are an app publisher on the App Store, listeners or customers can leave comments on the iTunes Store but there's no way to be notified if someone does - plus with all the international versions of the iTunes Store it would take forever to check in on all the different possible places someone could leave a comment for you<sup id="fnref-20470:1"><a href="#fn-20470:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, never mind all the different languages possible.</p>
<p><a href="http://marti.ca/">CommentCast</a>, $5 via PayPal, does some sort of magic to aggregate all the possible comments you can receive.</p>

I'm not an app developer so I don't know if there's some back end system Apple has in place for developers to be notified. I'm just a lowly podcaster.&#160;<a href="#fnref-20470:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
