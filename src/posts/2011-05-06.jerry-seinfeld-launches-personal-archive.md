<p>From the description:</p>
<blockquote><p>When I was ten years old, I started watching<br />
stand up comedians on TV.</p>
<p>I fell in love with them and I'm just as fascinated<br />
with stand up comedy today.</p>
<p>When I started doing TV, I saved every appearance<br />
on every show I did.</p>
<p>I thought it might be fun to go through all of it<br />
and pick out three bits each day that still<br />
amuse me for some reason or another.</p>
<p>I've also included stuff I'm doing now, and I'll be<br />
adding new stuff as I go.</p>
<p>Somewhere out there are ten year olds<br />
just waiting to get hooked on this strange pursuit.</p>
<p>This is for them.<br />
I'm just hoping somehow it will keep this silliness going.</p></blockquote>
