Matt's [got a list of podcasts](https://a.wholelottanothing.org/2018/08/10/my-podcast-diet-august-2018/) you may not have heard of to add to your listening schedule. He's broken them down by priority from "drop everything to listen to these" to "shows I occasionally pick up an episode when I hear it’s a good one".

> Podcast discovery is still a mostly-broken problem...There isn’t really a good app to share podcasts quite yet (Breaker seems to be getting there), so posts like this will suffice.

I personally think this is something that shouldn't be fixed by algorithms. I think podcast player apps need to make it super easy to auto-share episodes of a show you like to social media - as easy as it is on my favourite app [Pocket Casts](https://www.shiftyjelly.com/pocketcasts/), I should be able to just hit a heart and have that be shared automagically (whether from the app or via a bit of [If This Then That](https://ifttt.com) API wizardry):

I'd much rather hear about a great episode of a podcast from a friend and then be able to listen to that episode and decide whether I want to subscribe or not. I'm wary of any one podcast app/service that's going to try and take over the whole experience - despite that idea being what millions of investment money is likely flowing into these days. Keep your algorithms as far away from my podcasts as possible. Please.
