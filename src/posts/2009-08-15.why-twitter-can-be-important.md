title: "Why Twitter Can Be Important"
---
<p>Not that you have to pay attention to something like twitter, but just perhaps a bit of an understanding of why someone might want to:</p>
<blockquote><p>Twitter, in this sense, can be condensed to a stadium full of people.  Most everyone’s yelling something, and as a whole it’s an incomprehensible wash of noise.  Every once in a while, someone will start a chant…others pick it up and it grows…maybe to the point where it’s audible over the rest of the noise to a good portion of the stadium, causing other people to take notice of something they otherwise might have missed.  The object is not just to amass a small army of followers, but to get them to make noise about YOU.</p></blockquote>
