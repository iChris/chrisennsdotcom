<p>I talked to someone at the Telus store in Midtown and they are now allowed to sell the iPhone 4 - they don't have any stock.</p>
<p>Best Buy on 8th has (<em>had?</em>) just a single 16GB iPhone 4 in stock.  I haven't phoned around anywhere else yet.</p>
<p>I'm holding out for a 32GB version.  With HD video recording and a decent camera I don't want to have to worry about running out of space.  I <strong>have</strong> to have my N-Sync/Backstreet Boys/Spice Girls/New Kids on the Block collection with me at all times!</p>
