title: "Dadding My Way Through Minecraft"
---
<p>My son and I have been playing Minecraft on the Xbox 360 and I've been thinking that maybe there's other parents out there who's kids are asking them about Minecraft.</p>
<p>So I did what any self-respecting internet nerd and guy who loves making screencasts would do - I started a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/ichrisplaysminecraft">YouTube channel where I publish screencasts explaining Minecraft</a>. As of this posting there's 5 episodes up, starting from the basics of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wkh0M1MnJX8">buying and installing Minecraft</a> to the most current episode where <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_7LPgAQPrwc">I've started planting wheat and building a cow pen</a>. Really.</p>
<p>If you're interested, hit the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/ichrisplaysminecraft">subscribe button on the YouTube page</a> or check out the video playlist at the bottom of this post.</p>
<p>I'd love to answer any questions about Minecraft that you might have so leave a comment below or on the <a href="https://chrisenns.com/contact/">contact page</a> and I'll do my best to answer it in future episodes.</p>

<p>I feel like a bit of a dork that I'm (a) doing these videos and (b) talking about it publicly but I'm having lots of fun doing them and I know that at least four people have admitted to me that they've watched more than one of my videos so I'll continue. For now.</p>
