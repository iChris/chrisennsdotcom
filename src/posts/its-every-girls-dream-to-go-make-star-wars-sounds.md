For May the 4th, 2022, Apple published a behind the scenes look at creating the iconic sounds of the Star Wars universe. It opens with Bonnie Wild, who's worked on The Mandalorian, Moon Knight, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi.

I love how she nerds out over getting to work on these movies, and at the same time has a feeling like she's being *too* nerdy in how she gets excited.
