<p>For episode 5 of Canada's favourite podcast (<em>if you say something enough times, Google thinks it's true</em>), we chat about what people can expect from Barcamp Saskatoon and why you might want to attend - or speak - at Barcamp. Blaine and I then run down some of the week's top stories and news from the web.</p>
