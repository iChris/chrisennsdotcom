<p>From Harry McCracken, <a href="http://technologizer.com/2011/10/05/steve-jobs-1955-2011/" title="" target="">photographer at MacWorld when Jobs announced the original MacBook Air</a>.</p>
<p>The look of satisfaction and joy on Jobs' face is exactly the look you can see every time someone opens a box of Apple hardware for the first time. </p>
<p>The revealing of how something as inane as a bunch of chips and wires and silicon can be presented as something to be enjoyed and appreciated.</p>
