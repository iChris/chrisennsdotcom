title: "My Daily(ish) Podcast"
---
<p>I realized I haven't posted anything about it here but I've been doing a daily(ish) - heavy on the "ish" - podcast over at <a href="http://www.pdcst.ca/">pdcst.ca</a>. 10 minutes or less of me rambling about stuff on my brain. It's a bit of a relaunch of the original <a href="http://www.ssktn.com/category/tltb/">Too Lazy to Blog podcast</a> I had going for awhile.</p>
<p>It's mainly for my own curiosity and experiments in podcasting. As we continue to build <a href="http://goodstuff.fm">GoodStuff.fm</a>, I wanted to have a small space to mess around with podcasting. So that's where <a href="http://www.pdcst.ca">pdcst.ca</a> comes in.</p>
<p>You can start back <a href="http://www.pdcst.ca/1/">at episode 1</a> and continue from there or subscribe <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/podcast/pdcst/id815675012">in iTunes</a> or via <a href="http://www.pdcst.ca/feed/podcast/">RSS</a>. If you're on ADN, you can <a href="https://alpha.app.net/intent/subscribe/?channel_id=45359">subscribe to the Broadcast channel</a> and I also <a href="https://twitter.com/iChris">tweet out new episodes with direct links to the MP3s</a>.</p>
