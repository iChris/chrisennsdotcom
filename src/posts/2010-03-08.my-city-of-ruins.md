<p>Senseless violence like <a href="http://www.thestarphoenix.com/sports/StarPhoenix+journalist+hospital+after+assault/2630627/story.html">this</a> is hard for me to understand.  I cannot fathom how one person can leave another human being to die in the streets:</p>
<blockquote><p>Police arrived on scene, just blocks from Florence's Mayfair-area home. They found him conscious but unable to communicate and with a severe head injury, Voisard said. None of his belongings appear to have been stolen.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would guess it was either a gang initiation (i.e. go beat up some random person and you're in our club) or just a purely random stoned/drunk/whatever assault.  Whatever the reason, it isn't right.</p>

<blockquote><p>There's a blood red circle<br />
on the cold dark ground<br />
and the rain is falling down<br />
The church doors blown open<br />
I can hear the organ's song<br />
But the congregation's gone</p>
<p>My city of ruins<br />
My city of ruins</p>
<p>Now the sweet veils of mercy<br />
drift through the evening trees<br />
Young men on the corner<br />
like scattered leaves<br />
The boarded up windows<br />
The hustlers and thieves<br />
While my brother's down on his knees</p>
<p>My city of ruins<br />
My city of ruins</p>
<p>Come on rise up!<br />
Come on rise up!</p>
<p>Now there's tears on the pillow<br />
darling where we slept<br />
and you took my heart when you left<br />
without your sweet kiss<br />
my soul is lost, my friend<br />
Now tell me how do I begin again?</p>
<p>My city's in ruins<br />
My city's in ruins</p>
<p>Now with these hands<br />
I pray Lord<br />
with these hands<br />
for the strength Lord<br />
with these hands<br />
for the faith Lord<br />
with these hands<br />
I pray Lord<br />
with these hands<br />
for the strength Lord<br />
with these hands<br />
for the faith Lord<br />
with these hands</p>
<p>Come on rise up!<br />
Come on rise up!<br />
Rise up</p></blockquote>
