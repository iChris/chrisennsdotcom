<p>Omnifocus, (<a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fomnifocus%252Fid402835630%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Mac App Store - $79.99</a>), is the ultimate Mac nerd getting things done app.</p>
<p>I have yet to take the plunge, but I know that if and when I do I'll be relying on screencasts like <a href="http://www.macsparky.com/omnifocus-screencasts/">these from David Sparks</a> to figure out how to really make the most of <a href="http://www.omnigroup.com/products/omnifocus/">Omnifocus</a>.</p>
<p>When combined with <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fomnifocus-for-iphone%252Fid284885288%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">OmniFocus for iPhone ($19.99)</a> and/or <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fomnifocus-for-ipad%252Fid383804552%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">OmniFocus for iPad ($39.99)</a>, you'll be getting so many things done you won't know what to do with yourself.</p>
