<p>Via <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/2014/04/09/recap-apr-9th-2014/">Brett Terpstra’s ReCap</a> - this looks like a great app for creating presentation that's trying something different than your typical Powerpoint/Keynote style build:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Concentrate on the content and simply write down your thoughts and Deckset turns them into awesome-looking slides.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Great looking <a href="http://www.decksetapp.com/themes/">default themes</a> and writing/support for Markdown. Awesome.</p>
