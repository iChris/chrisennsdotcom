<p>If you've ever asked yourself: "I wonder what Chris found interesting on the web this past week?", I've got the answer for you!</p>
<p>I've relaunched my weekly newsletter and you can sign up below or at <a href="https://chris-enns.ongoodbits.com/">chris-enns.ongoodbits.com</a> to get a weekly email each Friday afternoon of the interesting blog posts, articles, tutorials, YouTube videos, and podcast episodes I came across in the previous week.</p>
<p>I'm using a service called <a href="https://goodbits.io/?utm_source=ChrisEnns">Goodbits</a> that makes it super easy to build email newsletters. Eventually I'll likely roll it into a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ichris">Patreon supporters only</a> type email but for now I want to make sure it's something that's easy enough to do and maintain. So if you sign up now, you can likely-maybe-possibly [footnote]as long as it's technically possible and not a ton of extra work[/footnote] stay subscribed if I flip it over to Patreon patrons only.</p>
<p>But you're going to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/ichris">support me on Patreon right away anyways, right?</a></p>
