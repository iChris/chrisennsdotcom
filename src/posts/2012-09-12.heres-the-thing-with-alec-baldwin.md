title: "Here''s the Thing with Alec Baldwin"
---
<p>Alec Baldwin, who's great as Jack Donaghy on <a href="http://www.nbc.com/30-rock/">30 Rock</a>, also has an excellent radio show/podcast where he interviews friends who also happen to be celebrities.</p>
<p>The most recent one I listened to was <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/2012/jan/30/">his interview with Lorne Micheals</a>, producer of <a href="http://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/">Saturday Night Live</a>. In particular I really liked this quote from Lorne on how SNL works:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  We don't go on because we're ready. We go on because it's 11:30.
</p></blockquote>
<p>They may not always hit it out of the park, but when you start to think about the constraints they operate under it's incredible just to get an hour and a half long live show on the air at all.</p>
<p>Also worth listening to is Alec's interview with <a href="http://www.wnyc.org/shows/heresthething/2012/jun/18/">David Letterman</a>.</p>
