I love this verse in Phoebe Bridger's song, [Chinese Satellite](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/chinese-satellite/1504699857?i=1504699865), from her 2020 album [Punisher](https://music.apple.com/ca/album/punisher/1504699857):

> You were screaming at the Evangelicals  
> They were screaming right back from what I remember  
> When you said I will never be your vegetable  
> Because I think when you're gone it's forever  
> But you know I'd stand on the corner  
> Embarrassed with a picket sign  
> If it meant I would see you  
> When I die  

True love is being willing to join an evangelical religion in the hopes that you'll get to spend eternity together.
