title: "Gotchas in the App Store Marketing Guidelines"
---
<p>Nate Heagy <a href="http://heagy.com/2013/02/04/app-store-marketing-guidelines/">wrote up 5 common mistakes developers make in marketing their apps for iOS</a> - one being that you can't just say your app is for iOS, you need to list the specific devices (iPod touch, iPhone, etc.).</p>
<p>Another requirement Apple has is that you are not allowed to use white Apple products in your advertisements or videos. It's odd since Apple obviously <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fdmkhzGD-ZA">has no problem using them in their ads</a>.</p>
<p>I know. You're shocked. Apple apparently has double standards for their developers. /sarcasm.</p>
