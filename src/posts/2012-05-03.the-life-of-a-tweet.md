<p>Yesterday I posted a tweet reply to <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/mrgan">Neven Mrgan</a>, one of the code/design nerds at <a href="http://panic.com/">Panic</a>, talking about how Pinterest's aim isn't to make money right away - but it is their goal down the road. I grabbed a <a href="http://l.ssktn.com/U7DV">screenshot of their FAQ page</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ichris/status/197790894118797314">sent it along as a reply</a>.</p>
<p><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Screenshot-2012-05-02-at-14.50.04.png" alt="Pinterest Goal of Making Money Someday" title="Pinterest Goal of Making Money Someday" width="664" height="319" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-20375" /></p>
<p>Naturally Neven thought my reply was <a href="https://twitter.com/mrgan/status/197791333635731457">hilarious</a> (<em>emphasis and assumptions of Neven's thoughts by your humble editor</em>) and retweeted it out to his 13k+ followers.</p>
<p><del>At which point I just sat back, took a sip of my coffee and waited for the royalty cheques to start flying into my mailbox because that's how the internet works right?</del></p>
<p><em>Ahem.</em></p>
<p>That all happened around 4pm on Wednesday. Being a bit of a stats nerd, I would periodically check the <a href="https://droplr.com">Droplr</a> stats for the image I sent in my reply. Each time someone clicked on the link in my tweet to the image, Droplr would register a view.</p>
<p>There was the initial rush of people who viewed it, somewhere between 350 and 450, and then the views slowed down to a trickle.</p>
<p>But what's interesting is how even now, 20+ hours later, there's still people clicking and viewing that screenshot as it approaches 600 views.</p>
<p>No big revelation or summary statement about society here. It's just a curious thing to me how different people keep up with the stream of information coming at them. Twitter to me is relevant information from the last few hours - anything beyond that I don't really worry about and can skim or skip past, other than close personal friends.<sup id="fnref-20374:1"><a href="#fn-20374:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>
<p>Others are more interested in reading or clicking everything someone tweets.</p>
<p>Or maybe my tweet was just so inspiring, funny and full of knowledge that people can't help but click the url to see what's on the other side.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to waiting for my internet cash machine to start printing dollar bills. Better go grab some ink.</p>

Unless Neven has thousands of close personal friends that follow him on Twitter? Could happen. He seems like a nice guy.&#160;<a href="#fnref-20374:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
