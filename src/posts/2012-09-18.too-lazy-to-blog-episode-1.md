<p>A relaunch of a podcast I had [previously published over at <a href="http://www.ssktn.com/shows/too-lazy-to-blog/">SSKTN</a>. I decided to use the name and rebrand it as a supplemental piece of content here on my blog.</p>
<p>For now I'll just say it's a semi-regular podcast that I'll release when I feel like I have something to talk about.</p>
<p>The podcasts I do over at <a href="http://www.ssktn.com">SSKTN</a> I typically am involving another person - which is what I really prefer - but it makes it hard to schedule and hard to keep consistent. This will hopefully give me a way to keep pushing myself and honing my podcast related skills as well as test and play with audio related workflow.</p>
<p>As always, I welcome your feedback.</p>
