title: "Last Chance to Buy Carcassonne on the Cheap"
---
<p>Today is the last day to get Carcassonne for only $4.99.  Sometime tomorrow they are releasing an update to make it native on the iPad as well as the iPhone 4 and with the update, the price apparently will be going up to $9.99.</p>

<p>It's one of the best board game to video game adaptations I've ever played.  And even though I routinely get trounced by everyone I play it with, I'd still highly recommend you pick up a copy.</p>
