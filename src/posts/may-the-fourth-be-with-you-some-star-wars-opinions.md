As a family we've been re-watching (or watching for the first time, as the case may be) the Star Wars saga over the past few months. For my nostalgia fuelled brain, it holds up so well. Of course itâ€™s not perfect. But I still love it. (Please don't @ me if you have complaints. Not interested.)

We didn't plan on finishing the series on#MayTheFourth, but it worked out that way - helped by the fact that we've watched The Force Awakens Saturday, The Last Jedi last night, and tonight we'll finish with The Rise of the Skywalker.
