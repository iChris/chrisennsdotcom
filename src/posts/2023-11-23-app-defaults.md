I love the way the web still works without any social media influence. Here's the internet rabbit trail that led me to creating this post:

1) I was adding a link to [omg.lol](https://home.omg.lol/), a blog and email hosting service that's cute AND easy AND (relatively) cheap, [to my newsletter](https://buttondown.email/lemonpodcasting).
2) While browsing their [help and info page](https://home.omg.lol/info), I saw that they offer a [/now/ feature](https://home.omg.lol/info/now) that lets you update the world on what you're working on, reading, watching, etc... now. Old school internet at it's best.
3) I clicked through to the [omg.lol /now garden](https://now.garden/) which has examples of how people are using /now to update the world.
4) I randomly picked [Rebecca Owen's /now page](https://beccaowen.omg.lol/now).
5) Then I clicked back through to [her omg.lol page](https://beccaowen.omg.lol/) to see how she was using it.
6) I saw she had a blog, so [I checked that out](https://beccais.online/).
7) The most recent post on Rebecca's blog was one called [Default Apps 2023](https://beccais.online/2023/11/default-apps-2023/). That's clickbait-up-arrow.gif material for me.
8) She had included a link to an episode a podcast called [Hemispheric Views](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/097), and this [defaults](https://defaults.rknight.me/) page.

Which is how I got around to posting a list of my defaults. No Meta / Twitter / TikTok needed. 😆

### My Defaults as of 2023-11-23

* 📨 Mail Client - I'm back on  Mail.app.
* 📮 Mail Server - Personal is Gmail, my [business](https://www.lemonproductions.ca/) is on G-suite or whatever it's called this month.
* 📝 Notes - A combination of  Notes (shared family stuff), [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com/), and [Notion](https://www.notion.so/?r=dcac6fd924e245dd86621799472ef24e).
* ✅ To-Do - Technically I'm using  Reminders. (*See Calendar for more*)
* 📷 iPhone Photo Shooting -  Camera app
* 🟦 Photo Management -  Photos app / PixelMator for graphics.
* 📆 Calendar - I recently switched to using [Fantastical](https://flexibits.com/fantastical), but my calendars and to do items are technically saved in  Reminders / Calendar's databases via iCloud.
* 📁 Cloud File Storage - I use Dropbox, Google Drive, and iCloud Drive to keep everything confusing.
* 📖 RSS - My RSS feed is stored in [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com/), and I use Feedbin on my Mac to read RSS feeds. On my iPhone, I'm back using [NetNewsWire](https://netnewswire.com/) but am really tempted to pick up [Reeder](https://reederapp.com/) and an iPad as  dedicated RSS reading hardware.
* 🙍🏻‍♂️ Contacts -  Contacts but with a side of [Cardhop](https://flexibits.com/cardhop), which is included in the Fantastical bundle subscription.
* 🌐 Browser - [Arc](https://arc.net/) is my daily driver for most things. I use  Safari for anything I think I might also want on my iPhone. And Chrome sometimes because I'm too lazy to move some bookmarks over.
* 💬 Chat - iMessage, [Discord](https://discord.com/), WhatsApp, Slack, FB Messenger, etc. etc. Basically wherever you are, I'll install an app for you.
* 🔖 Bookmarks - Safari's built in bookmarks bar is my default, and then I save bookmarks in a Notion database that I never remember to look at.
* 📑 Read It Later - [Reader by Readwise](https://readwise.io/read). I love the way it integrates with Readwise to show me highlighted quotes from articles I've read.
* 📜 Word Processing - Word what now? I guess Notion is where I write longer things down.
* 📈 Spreadsheets - I usually reach for Google Sheets for quick calculations, Numbers if it's something I know I want to keep, or [Soulver](https://soulver.app/) for my end of the month "is there enough money in the account to pay the bills" style budgeting.
* 📊 Presentations - I don't give many, but if I did I'd use  Keynote.
* 🛒 Shopping Lists - A shared Reminders list. iOS17's improvement of sorting the grocery list is a nice bonus.
* 🍴 Meal Planning - We have a family [Paprika](https://www.paprikaapp.com/) account that works, but we don't use it all the time.
* 💰 Budgeting and Personal Finance - I've been using [Lunch Money](https://lunchmoney.app/?refer=xs6ss9to), but it keeps losing the connection to my bank accounts which I don't think is Lunch Money's fault and is more to do with banks not wanting to give up your data.
* 📰 News - Generally RSS, Threads, or Mastodon. Apple News+ if I have to dig into something more.
* 🎵 Music - Apple Music via the Apple One Family bundle. Price increases have me thinking of going back to CDs though.
* 🎤 Podcasts - 99% of the time I use [Pocket Casts](https://pocketcasts.com/), and occasionally try out  Podcasts, Spotify, etc. as part of keeping up with my client's shows.
* 🔐 Password Management - We're on a [family 1Password](https://1password.com/personal) plan. If I wasn't on a discounted promo plan of some sort, I'd definitely be looking into the updated  [shared password](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/mac-help/mchlc00a3602/mac) set up since that's just easier in the  ecosystem these days.
