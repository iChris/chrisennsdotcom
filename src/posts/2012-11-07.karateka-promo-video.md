<p>It's how I often feel like answering when people ask <a href="http://lemonproductions.ca">how much a website design costs</a> as if there's a flat rate for designing &amp; building whatever it is they might be imagining in their head. I'm always happy to help people understand what's actually involved and the range of costs because I understand most people have no idea (nor should they) of how building a website works.</p>
