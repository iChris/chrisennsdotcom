<p>Also gives me a chance to try out Twitter and <a href="http://en.support.wordpress.com/twitter-embeds/">WordPress' support</a> for embedding a tweet in the page with full Twitter functionality.</p>
<p>I'm currently using the <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-blackbird-pie/">Blackbird Pie Plugin</a> which is the unofficial-offical WordPress version but it looks like <a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/twitter-embed/">Twitter-Embed</a> more closely follows the wording <a href="https://dev.twitter.com/docs/embedded-tweets">Twitter follows</a>.</p>
