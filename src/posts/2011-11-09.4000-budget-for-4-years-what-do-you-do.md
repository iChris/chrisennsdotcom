<p>Hypothetical situation <sup id="fnref-19770:1"><a href="#fn-19770:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> a friend is struggling with that could use some nerd advice.</p>
<h2>The Situation</h2>
<p>You're employed at a job that allows you to, more or less, decide what pieces of technology you're going to use with the following limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a $4,000 budget</li>
<li>The $4,000 has to last 4 years</li>
</ul>
<h3>Assumptions</h3>
<p>Disregarding all sorts of questions that this kind of question inevitably brings up (<em>What happens if your computer breaks down? What if there's a nuclear war?</em>), here's a few assumptions and limitations:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's a Mac environment. <sup id="fnref-19770:2"><a href="#fn-19770:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
<li>Cell phone device/contract also comes out of the budget. Cell phone is required.</li>
<li>Mobility is important but not critical.(i.e. an iPad for mobility with a desktop computer is an option)</li>
<li>The ability to do presentations with a projector (projector already in place)</li>
<li>Let's just pretend that taxes and extra cell charges aren't included</li>
<li>The office already has a printer, network, internet, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What I'd Recommend</h3>
<ul>
<li>11" MacBook Air ($1,199, 1.6GHz i5, 4GB RAM, 128GB SSD)</li>
<li>22" Monitor to leave at the desk ($260?)</li>
<li>iPhone 4S ($159 purchase price, 3 year data plan $50x36 months = $1,800)</li>
</ul>
<p>You're at $3,418 so far and haven't picked up any extra software, mouse, bag, etc. The 11" MacBook Air, to me, gives you the best trade-off of a portable (i.e. iPad) while still having the full functionality of a computer. Plus the ability to hook it up to a projector or larger monitor if that's needed is nice. <sup id="fnref-19770:3"><a href="#fn-19770:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>
<p>It's a tough task to try to account for technology over 4 years. It's good to think about and have restrictions - but $4k over 4 years feels a bit unrealistic for a modern office worker.</p>
<h3>What Would You Recommend?</h3>
<p>I've temporarily turned on comments below because I'd love to hear some discussion on what people would do.</p>
<p>Comments of "buy a Linux laptop with Windows 98" will be properly filed.</p>

I'm really happy you enjoy Linux/Windows/etc. &amp; that you can save money by buying something with poorer quality components and more viruses. But I don't really care.&#160;<a href="#fnref-19770:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
