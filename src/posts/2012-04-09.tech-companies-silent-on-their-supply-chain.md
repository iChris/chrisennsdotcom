<p>From The New York Times, <a href="http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/08/disruptions-on-worker-conditions-apples-rivals-are-silent/">an article </a> on all the focus on Apple while other companies hope nobody asks them about their supply chain.</p>
<p>Too late.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  In the last week I have asked Hewlett-Packard, Samsung, Microsoft and others about their reports on labor conditions. Most responded with a boilerplate public relations message. Some didn’t even respond.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The other companies include Barnes &amp; Noble, Dell, Lenovo, &amp; Amazon.</p>
