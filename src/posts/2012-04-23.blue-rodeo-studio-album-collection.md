<p>First of all, if you don't have any Blue Rodeo in your music collection - shame on you.</p>
<p>But here's an easy way to get caught up. <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Falbum%252Fthe-studio-album-collection%252Fid515053274%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">$90 for the entire Blue Rodeo Studio Album Collection</a>. 12 albums worth of material plus 25 music videos.</p>
<p>It's still got to be a bit of a hard sell for artists in this day and age to try and pitch a greatest hits bundle like this. Chances are most hardcore fans already have every album. Casual fans like me have their favourite 2 or 3 albums plus have cherry picked singles off iTunes already. Including 25 music videos is a great extra though. Normally these sell for $2 - $3 each when they're released. But who sits around watching music videos?</p>
<p>At $90 for 189 songs, less the 25 music videos, you're paying around $0.50 a song so it's a really good deal for their library of music.</p>
