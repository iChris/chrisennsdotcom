title: "Instapaper v4"

<p>An update to an already great app, version 4 of <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Finstapaper%252Fid288545208%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Instapaper ($4.99 in the App Store for iPhone/iPad)</a> adds, among other things, a <a href="http://jasonsantamaria.com/articles/instapaper-4">new icon, cleaned up typography, nicer colours and a redesigned logo</a>. And there's a whole bunch of <a href="http://www.marco.org/2011/10/17/instapaper-4-released">usability and technical improvements as well</a>.</p>

<p>Instapaper is good on the iPhone, but if you've got an iPad, you should definitely pick up a copy if you enjoy reading at all.</p>
<p>You can listen to the <a href="http://ssktn.com/podcasts/appsession/001-appsession-instapaper/">first episode of Appsession</a> where I talked about why I like it so much. I'll have to do an update of that episode with all the new stuff in version 4.</p>
