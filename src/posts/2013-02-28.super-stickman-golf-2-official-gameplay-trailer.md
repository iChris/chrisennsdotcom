<p>Your <a href="http://www.noodlecake.com/828/super-stickman-golf-2-official-gameplay-trailer/">first look at Super Stickman Golf 2</a> from Saskatoon based <a href="http://www.noodlecake.com">Noodlecake Studios</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The biggest addition to the game is A-Sync Multiplayer or what we are calling, Turn Based Multiplayer.  In this mode you can compete with your friends or randomly against strangers on a hole by hole basis.  If you played Song-Pop or Draw Something you will be familiar with the “you go first, then I play my turn, then I play the next turn, then wait for you” mechanic.  Oh yea, you will also be able to play this mode cross platform on iOS and Android.  How do you like them apples?
