<p>A successfully <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2102739237/battle-of-the-bulge-the-simulation-game-for-the-ip">Kickstarted game</a> that looks like a great way to spend 3 hours of a day if you're a military/history nerd. <a href="http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fbattle-of-the-bulge%252Fid521833787%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Battle of the Bulge for iPad from Shenandoah Studio is $9.99 in the App Store</a>.</p>
<p>I spent a few afternoons in high school setting up games of Axis &amp; Allies. By the time you got to play the game it was time to head home. This seems like a much better way to enjoy a game like this these days. Especially when you've got little kids running around that could knock over the game board.</p>
<p>You can check out a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/theShenandoahStudio?feature=watch">series of YouTube videos demoing the game</a> and read more about it at <a href="http://www.shenandoah-studio.com/products/botb/">Shenandoah Studios' website</a>.</p>
