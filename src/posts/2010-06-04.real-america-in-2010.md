<p>I really, really hope <a href="http://wonkette.com/415809/arizona-school-demands-black-latino-students-faces-on-mural-be-changed-to-white">this is a story</a> that's been spun to sound worse than it is - but I really have my doubts considering the source at <a href="http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2010/06/04/20100604arizona-mural-sparks-racial-debate.html">this newspaper</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>An Arizona elementary school mural featuring the faces of kids who attend the school has been the subject of constant daytime drive-by racist screaming, from adults, as well as a radio talk-show campaign (by an actual city councilman, who has an AM talk-radio show) to remove the black student’s face, and now the school principal has ordered the faces of the Latino and Black students to be changed to Caucasian skin.</p></blockquote>
<p>Change "black" or "latino" to "First Nations" and I'm not sure Canada, particularly Saskatchewan, fares much better to be honest.</p>
