<p>Apple has their annual World Wide Developer's Conference this week, with the keynote happening this morning where they're expected to announce <del datetime="2012-06-11T15:41:48+00:00">that they've cured cancer</del>, <del datetime="2012-06-11T15:41:48+00:00">developed a lunar colony</del>, <del datetime="2012-06-11T15:41:48+00:00">solved the mystery of how a Caramilk chocolate bar is made</del>, new updated versions of their hardware and/or software to make Apple nerds drool and fork over their wallets. Oh, and maybe a TV interface of some sort that will revolutionize the way you and I watch TV.</p>
<p><strong>Forever.</strong></p>
<p>In honour of this event, there's a few Mac developers that have put their wares on sale. I'll try and update this post throughout the week if new ones come up that I feel are worth mentioning.</p>

It's a quick note taking app described like this:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>
  In Drafts, you can get that text down quickly, and decide what to do with it later. Extensive output options let you send your text to Twitter, Facebook, email, SMS, a Calendar event, quickly save it to Dropbox or Evernote – or forward it to a growing list of other Apps such as OmniFocus, Things, The Hit List, Byword, Sparrow and more (see below for full list).

</ul>
<blockquote><p>
  ColorSnapper is an easy-to-use tool for quickly finding out the color of any pixel on the screen. It is activated via a system-wide hotkey (configurable), giving you a magnifying loupe to easily pick the pixel you need.<br />
  The resulting color is copied to clipboard in a format of your preference.
