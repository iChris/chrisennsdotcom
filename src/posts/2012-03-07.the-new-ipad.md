<p>No iPad 2S, 2HD, 3, iPad HDx2, etc. naming convention here. Just simply the new iPad. Which is exactly what everyone will be calling it.</p>
<p>I suspect the next iPhone will follow suite and be called simply 'the new iPhone'.</p>

<h2>Should You Buy The New iPad?</h2>
<p>If you already have a previous iPad, whether version 1 or 2, and you don't want to upgrade then just don't ever look at the new iPad's retina display. If it's anything like the difference between an iPhone 3GS and an iPhone 4 - once you see the new display your old iPad's screen will look pixellated and fuzzy, particularly when viewing text.</p>
<p><strong>Reality Distortion Field Version</strong>: If you don't already have an iPad and have been holding out, this is the version to finally <a href="http://store.apple.com/ca/browse/home/shop_ipad/family/ipad">take the leap and jump in with</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Normal Reality Version</strong>: You'll be fine without an iPad, new or otherwise. Pick up a used iPad 1 or 2 to play with iOS if you're curious.</p>
<p>The iPad really is a world-changing device whether you buy one or not. Especially when you consider it didn't even exist 2 years ago.</p>
