<p>More keys to understanding Apple:</p>
<blockquote><p>This is the key to modern Apple. It’s a big company, and it’s now wildly successful. It assumes that it can write a successful software product in any niche. It’s very talented and very confident. But always, at the back of its collective mind, is fear — the fear of depending on the kindness and competence of others, and the fearful memory of the days when it was cowering in a dark closet, waiting for the blow to fall, while the trade press laughed and jeered.</p></blockquote>

<p>This post was created completely on the iPad by the way. Definitely getting used to the keyboard and touch interface. And this is definitely the future. Remember that this is version 1 folks and for my money it's the best on screen keyboard/interface since Star Trek. :)</p>
