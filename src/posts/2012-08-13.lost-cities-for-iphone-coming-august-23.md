  While available on other platforms, from Facebook to - albeit briefly - Xbox Live Arcade, the iOS version of Reiner Knizia's game of risk and reward is easily the best, combining snappy controls with smart visuals and a surprisingly pleasant soundtrack.

<p>Not much on the <a href="http://lostcitiesapp.com">official website</a> as far as whether it's multiplayer only or if you'll be able to play against the computer. But the company making Lost Cities is the same group behind <a href="http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fcarcassonne%252Fid375295479%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">the excellent iOS version of Carcassonne</a> so I'm sure it'll be good.</p>
