<p>One area I hadn't considered in my previous post, <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2011/10/12/imessage-vs-bbm/">iMessage vs BBM</a>, was how this will affect international communication.</p>
<p>With most cell phone providers you pay a lot more for international texting rates than you do for in-country texting. Now, if your friends or family have an iOS5 compatible device those costs are gone. There's no fees associated with sending an iMessage to another iMessage compatible device.</p>
<p>In yesterday's recording of <a href="http://ssktn.com/shows/lostandlemon/">Lost & Lemon</a> (not out as of yet), my <a href="http://shop.lostwaxoz.com/">brother in law in Australia</a> was asking if he should upgrade his iPod touch to iOS5. Aside from stuff that's neat or fun, I couldn't come up with a really compelling reason to upgrade right away - eventually, sure, but no rush. iMessage could change that in the same way that FaceTime did for iOS4.</p>
<h3>How to Use iMessage</h3>
<p>Macworld has a great <a href="http://www.macworld.com/article/162984/2011/10/ios_5_imessage.html">writeup on how to set up iMessage</a> but one thing I like is how iOS5 makes it easy to tell if you're sending a text message or an iMessage - the message entry field tells you as well as a colour change:</p>
<p>Text Message:<br />

<p>iMessage:<br />

<p>One other feature that's new in iMessage is the ability to swipe down on your messages to get rid of the keyboard. Handy if you're in the middle of a longer conversation and can't remember what's been said.</p>
