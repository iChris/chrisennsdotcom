<p>Evan Williams, one of the creators of Twitter, posting on his company's newest platform called <a href="http://medium.com">Medium</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If you don’t know the people, or don’t care, it’s probably not social media. It’s just media. It doesn’t matter if it’s created by an individual or a corporation.
