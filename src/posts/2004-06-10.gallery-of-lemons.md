<p>I've been half-heartedly trying out <a href="http://gallery.sourceforge.net/">Gallery</a> for over a year now over on Sue's <a href="http://www.oatways.com">family site</a> and thought I'd test my linux nerd-age by trying to install it on my <a href="http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com">home machine</a>.  Wouldn't you know it, <a href="http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com/gallery/">it actually worked?</a></p>
<p>It's mainly because there's no MySQL required and PHP comes preinstalled on Mandrake (and most current Linux distros) so a monkey could do it really.</p>
