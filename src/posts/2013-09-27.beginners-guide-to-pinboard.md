<p>Shawn Blanc wrote <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/2013/09/pinboard-guide/">A Beginner's Guide to Pinboard</a> to explain how he uses Pinboard, a bookmarking/link saving service that I use as well - you can <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:iChris">view my account here</a>.</p>

  A good filing system is one where you can find whatever you’re looking for in less than a minute. As of this sentence I have 2,334 bookmarks — I use Pinboard to collect any and every URL that is or was interesting to me — and I’ve never had trouble finding what I’m looking for when I go to search for a particular bookmark.</p>
<p>  I wanted to share a few of the tools and services I am using with Pinboard. If you are wanting to get more out of Pinboard, then hopefully this will help you out.

<p>Pinboard isn't the same as saving bookmarks in your browser. These aren't typically sites you visit on a daily basis. These are sites, articles, tutorials, photo galleries, etc. that you come across that you want to save for later. In fact, I <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:iChris/b:b1aa205237a7">saved Shawn's article to Pinboard</a> so that I could access it later when I have more time to dig into it.</p>
<p>It's currently $10.21 <sup id="fnref-21643:1"><a href="#fn-21643:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> to sign up for a <a href="http://pinboard.in/">Pinboard account</a>. Well worth it in my opinion.</p>

The price goes up as more people sign up. More users = more servers = higher costs to run the service.&#160;<a href="#fnref-21643:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a>
