I guess its time I post on here and give some of my thoughts, rather than just snaps of Damien!</p>
<p>Damien is 4 weeks old and changing all the time.  Going into my second week without Chris, I can totally understand the need for consistency and a schedule to keep yourself sane!  I now understand how our friends with kids need to have some major down time to get their kids back to normal after lots of outings and socializing.  The question is, how do you keep a social life and still maintain the consistency your baby needs to stay on a schedule?  Hmmm... I guess I'll just have to keep figuring that one out.</p>
<p>I defintely have enjoyed being a mom so far, but the hardest part for me is not being able to have big chunks of time to accomplish stuff.  Rather than spending the morning cleaning my house and getting it done, I need to break it into 1/2 - 1 hour jobs, and be ok if even those don't all get done.  I guess I have to stop getting my self-worth from what I've accomplished in a day!  For those of you that really know me, you know that will be quite difficult. :)</p>
