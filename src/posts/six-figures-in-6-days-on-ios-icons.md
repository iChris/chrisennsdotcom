A crazy story of Apple simply [allowing power users to change icons](https://www.macrumors.com/how-to/change-app-icons/) for apps on iOS [made a designer / developer over $100k in a week](https://tr.af/6):

> The next thing I knew, I was making $28 what felt like every 28 seconds. My phone turned into the ultimate dopamine dispenser (if it wasn't already).

All from a [single tweet](https://twitter.com/traf/status/1307707156788060160) that caught fire and went viral. It's a [very nice icon set](https://icons.tr.af/).

The most important part of it all is how Traf acknowledges the key to "overnight success":

> In the same way that creating icon sets 7 years ago prepared me for last week, this whole experiment has likely prepared me for what's to come years from now.

Overnight success is rarely that. It's often years spent trying to figure out a path and direction, perfecting a craft.
