Sometime after the introduction of iMessage in late 2011, my wife's family was looking for a way to include non-iPhone using family members in texting style conversations. iMessage, and now Messages, is notoriously horrible for group messaging threads that include non-iOS users. I don't remember if it was me that specifically recommended it or not, but I do remember suggesting [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) as an option, possibly along with a few other apps like it at the time. And that's what we all went with and have been using to this day.

In early 2014, [Facebook bought WhatsApp for an incredible, even by 2020 standards, $19 billion dollars](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/why-facebook-bought-whatsapp) because WhatsApp was becoming more popular than it's own Facebook Messenger.
