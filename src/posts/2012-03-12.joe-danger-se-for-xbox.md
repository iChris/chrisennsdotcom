<p>My 4 year old son and I played through the demo last night and we were both having a great time with it. If you ever played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Excitebike">Excitebike back on NES</a>, it's a great take on that style of gameplay only with modern graphics, fun audio and great animations and soundtrack.</p>
