<p>DaisyDisk is a graphical utility for the Mac that allows you to see what's using up the storage on your computer.</p>

<p>I've used a free tool for a while called <a href="http://grandperspectiv.sourceforge.net/">GrandPerspective</a> which certainly works - but it's nowhere near as nice looking or as nice to use as DaisyDisk.</p>
<p>DaisyDisk is great for finding out where all the space is going on your hard drive. For example, I had no idea that I had 60+ gigabytes in podcasts stored on my computer that I didn't need to keep around.</p>
<p>These kind of apps are especially useful as more and more people are switching their primary storage to something <strong>smaller</strong> instead of larger. With SSD drives becoming the norm in laptops like Apple's MacBook Air, you need to make sure you're doing a better job of managing all the data on your computer - at least if you're a digital pack rat like I am.</p>
