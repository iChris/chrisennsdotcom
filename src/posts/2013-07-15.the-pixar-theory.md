title: "The Pixar Theory"
---
<p>As seen on <a href="http://512pixels.net/2013/07/negroni-pixar/">512pixels.net</a>: a theory that all the films from Pixar fit into one world timeline. <a href="http://jonnegroni.com/2013/07/11/the-pixar-theory/">Read it when you have a few minutes</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Every movie is connected and implies major events that influence every single movie. Here we go. Brave is the first and last movie in the timeline. Obviously, this movie about a Scottish kingdom during the Dark Ages is the earliest time period covered by the Pixar films, but it’s also the only Pixar movie that actually explains why animals in the Pixar universe behave like humans sometimes.
