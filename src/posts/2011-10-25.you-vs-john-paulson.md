<p>Today's depressing link of the day - <a href="http://mahifx.com/">Mahifx.com</a> is a promo site for a new online trading site that compares your income to that of John Paulson, a financial trader who earned a record $4.9 billion in 2010.</p>

<p>Depressing financially speaking, but it's a really well designed single page site that takes advantage of scrolling to reveal data.</p>
