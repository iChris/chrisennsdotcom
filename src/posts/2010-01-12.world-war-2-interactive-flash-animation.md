title: "World War 2 Interactive Flash Animation"

<p>For any World War 2/history buffs out there, <a href="http://english.pobediteli.ru/flash.html?DR=0">this flash animation/movie</a> is a great visual of how World War 2 went down.</p>

<p>You may have to wait a bit for the flash to load as it's quite a large file/site - but well worth it if that kind of thing interests you at all.  Kind of makes me want to pull out that copy of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axis_&_Allies">Axis and Allies</a> that I have that's never actually been used.</p>
