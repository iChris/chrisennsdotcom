<p><a href="http://www.seattlerex.com/seattle-rex-vs-apple-the-verdict-is-in/">This is the side of corporate Apple</a> that the shiny, happy side of Apple doesn't want you to see.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  At one point, the judge asked Apple how much it would have cost them to have simply replaced my logic board when I had taken it in, and one of the Apple guys said “Oh, it wouldn’t have cost us anything, Nvidia foots the bill for each board we replace.”</p>
<p>  The judge’s face almost hit the floor as he shot me a quizzical look, to which I just shrugged. I knew that he, and everyone else in the courtroom was thinking the same thing:</p>
<p>  If Apple could have replaced my logic board at no cost to themselves, then why in the hell did they drag this out for so long, and why did they send two people to court to try and make sure that I got absolutely nothing? Friends, this is a question I have been asking myself for three months, and it is a question that I do not have the answer to.

<p>I've had similar experiences while working in retail. 9 times out of 10, Apple is great to the customer. It's why they keep winning the <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-13506_3-20108336-17/apple-tops-in-customer-satisfaction-for-8th-year/">customer satisfaction awards</a> year in and year out.</p>
<p>But if you're in that group that for whatever reason Apple decides isn't worth helping, all of a sudden the Apple juice starts to taste pretty sour.</p>
<p>Glad this guy got his money back from Apple, but there's no way it should've taken going to court over.</p>
