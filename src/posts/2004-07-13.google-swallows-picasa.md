title: "Google Swallows Picasa"
---
<p>I noticed today that <a href="http://www.google.com/press/pressrel/picasa.html">Google bought out Picasa.</a>  Picasa Software makes the <a href="http://www.picasa.com/picasa/">best photo organizing program</a> this side of <a href="http://www.apple.com/ilife/iphoto/">iPhoto</a> and I seriously recommend it to anyone using a digital camera on a Windows machine.  It will make managing your photos so much easier - and for any <a href="http://www.blogger.com">bloggers</a> out there, apparently it integrates well with your blogs!</p>
<p>It'll be the best $29US you've ever spent on your computer.</p>
