<p>Gay Byrne was the David Letterman/Johnny Carson of Ireland and the Late Late Show was the talk show to get on.</p>
<p>Besides Bono's great hair you'll also get a glimpse of a young Ali Hewson - his wife to this day. No easy feat for a lead singer of the one of the biggest bands in the world.</p>
