<p>Betaworks is letting you check out the <a href="http://blog.instapaper.com/post/57817543037">beta version of the new Instapaper website</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When the betaworks team sat down with Instapaper’s creator, <a href="http://marco.org/">Marco Arment</a>, back in April to get a download of his ideas and to-dos for improving Instapaper, the first thing on his list was to update the Instapaper website. Well we’ve done it, and it’s now ready for you to check out and test.

<p>Looks good. Can't wait to see what they do with the updated version of the iOS app.</p>
<p>I've tried to use <a href="http://getpocket.com">Pocket</a> but I keep coming back to Instapaper as my go to read-it-later app of choice. The iOS version could certainly use some polish and shine, but it still works great.</p>
