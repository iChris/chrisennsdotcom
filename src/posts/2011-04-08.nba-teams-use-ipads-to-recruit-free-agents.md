<p>Carlos Boozer, now with the Chicago Bulls, <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/chicago/nba/news/story?id=6295833">had a rep from the Bulls come to his hotel during the free agent process</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>He presented to Boozer the newest and most cutting-edge recruitment tool that the Bulls, and several other NBA teams, had used: a decked-out iPad with a personalized app for the newly minted free agent, detailing how he would fit in with the Bulls if he would sign.</p></blockquote>
<p>Turns out, as is typical when something new like this comes along, a lot of other teams used the same method:</p>
<blockquote><p>Boozer wound up having a stack full of iPads by the end of free agency.</p></blockquote>
