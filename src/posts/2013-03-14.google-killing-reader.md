title: "Google Killing Reader"
---
<p>Google has <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html">announced that they're shutting down Reader</a> effective July 1st, 2013.</p>
<p><a href="http://reader.google.com">Reader</a> is a RSS subscription manager/reader service Google made for free that effectively destroyed any other service available at the time that might compete - why would you use something else when Google made Reader for free?</p>
<p>You either depend completely on Google Reader for managing your RSS feeds, like me, or you have no idea why so many nerds are gnashing their teeth over this decision by Google.</p>
<p>I posted a question on Twitter earlier today wondering if Gmail could be next in line for Google's house cleaning:</p>

<p>I got some responses from <a href="http://www.avclark.com">Adam Clark</a> and <a href="http://timothybsmith.com">Tim Smith</a>, both podcasters among other things, and we decided to record an episode of Too Lazy to Blog to talk about Reader's demise, the merging of two podcast networks in <a href="http://5by5.tv">5by5</a> and <a href="http://70decibels.com">70Decibels</a>, and also Tim's new training site for front end developers appropriately titled <a href="http://timlikestoteach.com/">Tim Likes to Teach</a>.</p>
