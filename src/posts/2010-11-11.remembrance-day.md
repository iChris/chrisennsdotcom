<p>On this, the 11th of November, I choose to remember those who gave their life or who gave a big part of their life for the freedoms and opportunities I have.</p>

<p>Having recently been witness to the funeral of a veteran where the Legion honored their brother who had passed, it was a vivid reminder of the men and women who are living with the memory of war(s) in their lifetime.</p>
<p><strong><em>Lest we forget.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong><em>Lest we forget.</em></strong></p>
<p>I write articles complaining about how hard it is to get an iPhone, and other modern issues. And while one train of thought might suggest that a veteran might say “How dare you complain?” I have never felt that kind of attitude coming from any veteran I've talked with. There's none of the bitterness and cynicism that we all carry around with us today.</p>
<p>These people who risked their lives are happy to see us enjoy the freedoms they helped provide. It brings them joy. And all they ask is that once a year we put poppies on our shirts and pause to remember those that didn't get to see the joy they were providing, that didn't get to come home to a hero's welcome, and whose moms and dads had to open a letter telling them that their child wouldn't be coming back.</p>
