<p>Atari has released an app for the iPhone/iPad called <a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fataris-greatest-hits%252Fid422966028%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Atari's Greatest Hits</a> (<em>iTunes affiliate link</em>) that comes with one game - Pong. You can then, using in app purchases, buy packs of other games ($0.99 for 4 games) or all 100 games for $14.99.</p>
<p>You owe it to your children and your children's children to install this app and show them our history, our heritage, where we came from.</p>
<p>And then if you're really serious, pick up an <a href="http://www.thinkgeek.com/electronics/retro-gaming/e762/">iCade</a> to plug your iPad into and show them how it was really played back in the day.</p>
