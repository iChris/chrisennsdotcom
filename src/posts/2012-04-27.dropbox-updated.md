<p>Version 1.40 of Dropbox has been released. <a href="http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=1165">Photo uploading</a> is the big feature.</p>
<p>It's a bit ironic that the service so many of us rely on for keeping things up to date doesn't have the ability to keep itself up to date - but that's the way it is.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/install">Download it here</a> or if you're not using Dropbox already, <a href="http://db.tt/czHe7sK">go here to signup</a> and we'll both get a bit more space.</p>
<p>I'm a paying Dropbox user, but who can't use more free space right?</p>
