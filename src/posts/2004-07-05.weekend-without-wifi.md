<p>(that's pronounced "Why F-eye", not wiffi btw)</p>
<p>A weekend without wifi is like a weekend without warm weather.  Oh wait.. I got to experience both this weekend.  :)</p>

<p>Some new pics up in <a href="http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com/gallery/homeimprov">home improvement</a> (we painted our bedroom), <a href="http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com/gallery/Friends">friends</a> (BBQ and video gamin at our 'summer home' - props to Ging and Larissa for making the trek to hang out with us), and a couple new pics (<a href="http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com/gallery/Artsy-Farty/IMG_1415">1</a>, <a href="http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com/gallery/Artsy-Farty/IMG_1403">2</a>) in the <a href="http://chrisenns.isa-geek.com/gallery/Artsy-Farty">Artsy Fartsy</a> gallery - doing some fooling around with the macro mode on my camera.</p>
<p>We watched <a>In America</a> on Saturday night and then watched it again last night with the director's commentary on.  I'm a sucker for all things Irish and so I may be a bit biased, but it's a great movie.  The acting by the two young girls in it is worth the rental alone.</p>
<p>Speaking of Irish stuff, someone was apparently hanging outside U2's studio and recorded a possible new <a href="http://www.mennoboy.com/chris/archives/music/New U2_.mp3">U2 song</a>.  The sound of the wind is just all the hot air coming from Bono's mouth.  (<i>Grabbed from <a href="http://www.u2log.com">U2log.com</a>.</i>)</p>
