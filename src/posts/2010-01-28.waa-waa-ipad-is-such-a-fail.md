<p>We get it, you don't think the iPad is going to sell, it's a stupid name, it doesn't have a camera, it's dumb that Apple doesn't allow you to install your own apps on it, <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/28/flash-ipad">it doesn't run Flash</a> (<em><a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/01/apple_adobe_flash">See this piece by Gruber for a response to Flash and why you'll never see it on the iPhone/iPad</a></em>), that everything has to go through the App store, that it doesn't do X, Y or Z.</p>

<p>Need I remind you that the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_iPhone_and_iPod_Touch_models">original iPhone</a> came out with only a camera on it when pretty much all the other cell phones had video recording capabilities.  The original iPhone had (<em>and still has</em>) a non-removable battery.  The original iPhone couldn't  (<em>and still can't</em>) run Flash.  etc. etc. etc.  And that iPhone has <a href="http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2010/01/25results.html">done fairly well for Apple wouldn't you say?</a></p>
<p>So if the iPad doesn't spit out Unicorn breath in bite size tablets (<em>Ha!  See what I did there?  Tablets?  Cuz everyone thinks the iPad is a new kind of tablet?  Nevermind...</em>) like you were expecting it to and therefore you're not going to buy one, fine.  I don't think Apple is marketing this to you and they weren't expecting you to buy it anyway.  They aren't trying to <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5458690/the-problem-with-the-apple-ipad">take away your control</a> - you have a free will to buy the iPad/iPhone or not.  There are a _ton_ of other cell phones, tablets and computer choices out there.  Apple is making a lot (as in <strong>a lot</strong>) of money in the mobile area but they are far from the only choice.</p>
<p>So continue to buy your NokiaSonyMotorola mobile phone, linux powered Netbooks and cheap-like-borscht WinTel machines.  They aren't going anywhere.  You have that choice.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong>:  Even better response than I could write <a href="http://cruftbox.com/blog/archives/001592.html#001592">here</a> via <a href="http://daringfireball.net/linked/2010/01/28/cruftbox">Daring Fireball</a>.</p>
