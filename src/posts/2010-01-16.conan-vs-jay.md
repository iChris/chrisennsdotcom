<p>It takes guts to walk away from any job over something that doesn't line up with your values and principles.  When your job is a late night talk show seen by millions and worth millions of dollars and by leaving you are also putting a whole crew of people out of work, that takes some serious stones:</p>

<p>I'm sure Conan will end up on his feet somewhere.  There's no way, if he actually wants to, that he won't have options elsewhere.  And in light of <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2010/01/15/prayers-in-the-dark/">everything else going on in the world</a>, who really cares right?</p>
