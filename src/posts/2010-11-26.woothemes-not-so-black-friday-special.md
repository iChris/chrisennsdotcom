<p>I don't normally post affiliate links/etc. here, but this is a really good one that you should check out if you're looking for a WordPress theme for your blog/website:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=b38"><img src="http://woothemes.com/ads/300x250a.jpg" border=0 alt="WooThemes - WordPress themes for everyone" width="300" height="250" class="aligncenter"></a></p>
<p>They are offering 5 themes for the price of 1, plus 20% off the price of that one theme. It ends up costing you $56 (USD I believe) for 5 themes if you use coupon code "<strong>BLACKPACKAGE</strong>" at checkout.</p>
<p>WooThemes is who I get most of my WordPress themes through and they do a quality job, not only on the design of the theme itself but also in how easy they make it to setup your website with a ton of options in the administration menu.</p>
<p>Here's a screenshot from their <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l64">Canvas theme</a> that I often use as a starting point:</p>
<p><a href="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/canvasthemeoptions.jpg"><img src="https://chrisenns.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/canvasthemeoptions-300x246.jpg" alt="" title="Canvas Theme Options" width="300" height="246" class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-19293" /></a></p>
<p>So go <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l1">check out their collection of themes</a> and upgrade your blog to a new look.  Then be sure to come back and <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2010/11/26/woothemes-not-so-black-friday-special/#comments">leave a comment</a> so I can check out your new site!</p>
