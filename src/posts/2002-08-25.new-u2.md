<p>The u2 news site I work with has got the new u2 song already - apparently it was played earlier this morning on the BBC. Click here to check it out!</p>
<p>(read on for chords and lyrics if you're so inclined)<br />
Electrical Storm (lyrics)</p>
<p>Intro: F#m / A / E / B</p>
<p>Verse:<br />
F#m / A / B<br />
The sea it swells like a sore head<br />
F#m / A / B<br />
and the night it is aching<br />
F#m / A / B<br />
Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed<br />
F#m / A / B<br />
and the day it is breaking</p>
<p>F#m / A / B<br />
On rainy days we go swimming out<br />
F#m / A / B<br />
on rainy days, swimming in the sound<br />
F#m / A / B<br />
On rainy days we go swimming out</p>
<p>Pre-Chorus(?):<br />
D E C#m<br />
You're in my mind all of the time<br />
D<br />
I know that's not enough<br />
D E<br />
if the sky can crack<br />
C#m<br />
there must be some way back<br />
D<br />
for love and only love</p>
<p>Intro: F#m / A / E / B</p>
<p>2nd Verse, Same as the First:</p>
<p>Car alarm won't let you back to sleep<br />
you're kept awake dreaming some else's dream<br />
coffee is cold, but it will get you through<br />
compromise, that's nothing new to you<br />
let's see colours that have never been seen<br />
let's go to places no one else has been</p>
<p>Pre-Chorus(?):<br />
You're in my mind all of the time<br />
I know that's not enough<br />
if the sky can crack<br />
there must be some way back<br />
to love and only love</p>
<p>Chorus:</p>
<p>D / E<br />
F#m A<br />
Electrical Storm<br />
D / E<br />
F#m A<br />

Baby don't cry</p>
<p>Intro: F#m / A / E / B (2x)</p>
<p>Verse Chords: (F#m / A / B)<br />
It's hot as hell, honey in this room<br />
sure hope the weather will break soon<br />
the air is heavy, heavy as a truck<br />
hope the rain will wash away our bad luck</p>
<p>D / E / C#m / D<br />
heeeey... heeeey.....</p>
<p>D / E / C#m / D<br />
If the sky can crack, there must be some way back<br />
for love and only love</p>

Baby don't cry</p>
