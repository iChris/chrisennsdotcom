title: "The Basics of Markdown"
---
<p>I use <a href="http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/">Markdown</a> style writing to keep notes on my computer and iPhone. It helps keep me sane in how I record show notes for <a href="http://ssktn.com">podcasts</a> and when I'm writing draft posts for this blog and others.</p>
<p>I keep meaning to record a screencast and write a blog post with details on how and why I use Markdown - but until that time I wanted to point people to <a href="http://ryanirelan.com">Ryan Irelan's</a> <a href="http://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/basics-of-markdown/">excellent screencast titled The Basics of Markdown</a>.</p>
<p>For only $9 you will learn how to:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Create portable, styled documents with Markdown, a simple-to-use markup language for web writing and more. In this 33 minute video, learn the syntax and the tools you can use to create beautiful Markdown documents.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Ryan's a really-smart-guy™ who's also a great teacher and when he's not helping keep the <a href="http://happycog.com/">cogs happy at Happy Cog</a> he also publishes video training materials at <a href="http://mijingo.com">Mijingo</a>.</p>
<p>I recently watched his free video on <a href="http://mijingo.com/products/screencasts/budgets-with-soulver/">using Soulver to create budgets</a> - <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2013/02/app-store-get-stuff-done-week-3-sale/">which is still on sale in the App Store I believe</a> - and very quickly understood the app and could tell it'd be worth picking up.</p>
