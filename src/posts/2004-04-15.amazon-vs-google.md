<p>Amazon has released their own <a href="http://www.a9.com/">search engine</a> to compete with google.  It's amazing how history repeats itself.  Yahoo steals from Netscape, Google does Yahoo one better and now Amazon builds on what Google has done and improves it.</p>
<p>I'm still waiting for my gmail invite.  Grrrrr.</p>
