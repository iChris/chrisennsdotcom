title: "Recording an iPad mini Display for App Reviews"

<p>Starting with the iPhone 4S, iPad 2 and now the iPad mini, you're able to use AirPlay to send what you see on your iOS device to an AppleTV. Great for using your iPad for <a href="http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fkeynote%252Fid361285480%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Keynote</a> or playing a game on a big screen.</p>
<p>If you add in an extra Mac application called <a href="https://www.reflectorapp.com">Reflector ($14.99)</a>, you can use your Mac as the output device so you can see what's on the iPad on your Mac. Throw in a screen capture program like <a href="http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fscreenflow-4%252Fid573279886%253Fmt%253D12%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">ScreenFlow 4 ($99)</a> and you can record videos of your iPad or iPhone which are great for training or reviews.</p>
<p>I recorded a quick test using Reflector and Screenflow while I played a quick game of <a href="http://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fski-safari%252Fid503092422%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">Ski Safari ($0.99)</a>.</p>

<p>Add a little voice over and a few title/graphics and you could do a pretty professional looking app review or promo/training video for a new app.</p>
<p>What do you think? Worth doing for a few apps I talk about on here?</p>
