<p>A great collection of stories and memories as well as the impact Steve and Apple had on their lives as creative professionals.</p>

<p>Great other than Kristina Halvorson mispronouncing Steve Jobs' name. My apologies if she has a speech impediment when saying the word "job", but how do you not know how to say the man's name at this point?</p>
<p>And yes, I know I said I wasn't going to post anymore about Steve Jobs - but I reserve the right to be contradictory on my own blog. If you're sick of reading/hearing about it, there's <a href="http://www.google.ca/search?client=safari&rls=en&q=my+mommy+didn't+hug+me+enough&ie=UTF-8&oe=UTF-8&redir_esc=&ei=fliPTtTCLPGDsgK_zY27AQ">plenty of other places to go on the internet</a>.</p>
