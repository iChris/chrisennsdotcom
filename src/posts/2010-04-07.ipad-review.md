<p>No, sadly, I don't have one.  For the definitive review, check out <a href="http://daringfireball.net/2010/04/the_ipad">John Gruber's article simply titled 'The iPad'</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>After the iPad was announced, I got two types of emails from readers. The first group saying they were disappointed, because they had been hoping I was right that The Tablet would be Apple’s reconception of personal computing.</p>
<p>The second group wrote to tell me how excited they were because I was right that The Tablet would be Apple’s reconception of personal computing.</p>
<p>Count me in with the second group. Apple hasn’t thought of everything with iPad, but what they’ve thought about, they’ve thought about very deeply. I got mine Saturday morning, and I’ve been using it since — or at least as often as I could <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/gruber/4487367853/">get it away from my son</a>. Here are my thoughts.</p></blockquote>
<p>I stand by my <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2010/01/28/waa-waa-ipad-is-such-a-fail/">earlier</a> <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2010/01/30/one-more-ipad-post/">assertions</a> that the iPad is going to be a _big_ deal.</p>
<p>I heard on CBC radio this morning that the entire tablet PC market last year was around 1.5 million (<em>I don't have anything official to back that stat up so your mileage may vary</em>).  Apple has unofficially sold <a href="http://labs.chitika.com/ipad/">over 500,000</a> iPads in less than a week - and that's before the 3G mobile data plan equipped models are available.</p>
