  30 minutes later I have a clearer picture of what this game actually does. Taken by its individual parts, it's nothing particularly outlandish. It's a space-exploration game with heavy resource-gathering elements. But taken as a sum of its parts, it's a game that demands attention and, still, expectation.

<p>No Man's Sky, along with <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2015/6/15/8779893/star-wars-battlefront-gameplay-e3-2015">Star Wars: Battlefront</a>, are enough reason to have me pining for a Playstation 4.</p>
<p>From where I sit on my couch playing video games once a week with my kids, Sony seems to have won E3 this year.</p>
