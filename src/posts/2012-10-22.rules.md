<blockquote><p>
  If there’s no viral action on your music, you’re just not good enough. Don’t get mad at the audience, get mad at yourself. Either give up or get better.

<p>Great stuff from Bob Lefsetz on rules for the music industry - but the same can be applied to other creative endeavours online.</p>
