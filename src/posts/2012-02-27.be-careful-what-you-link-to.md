<p>By linking to a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MR3IVO">55 gallon drum of water-based lubricant on Amazon</a> from his Facebook page, he became <a href="http://nbergus.com/2012/02/how-i-became-amazons-pitchman-for-a-55-gallon-drum-of-personal-lubricant-on-facebook/">Amazon's pitchman for said lubricant to his friends</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Amused, I posted it to Facebook with the line “A 55-gallon drum of lube on Amazon. For Valentine’s Day. And every day. For the rest of your life.” And then I went on with my life.<br />
  A week later, a friend posts a screen capture and tells me that my post has been showing up next to his news feed as a sponsored story, meaning Amazon is paying Facebook to highlight my link to a giant tub of personal lubricant.<br />
  Other people start reporting that they’re seeing it, too. A fellow roller derby referee. A former employee of a magazine I still write for. My co-worker’s wife. They’re not seeing just once, but regularly. Said one friend: “It has shown up as one on mine every single time I log in.”

<p>In this day and age, it's good to keep in mind that if the service or web site you're using isn't charging you anything, there's a good chance <strong>you</strong> are the product.</p>
