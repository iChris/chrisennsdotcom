<p>Great news for Don and all his hard work trying to get his apps back in the App Store:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The bottom line is that Apple will approve the latest app - SCOtutor for iBooks Author - which is the "re-engineered" version of the App, and will re-instate the other older versions of the Apps, but I will need to bring them up to the latest version.

<p>I'll post links as soon as they're back in.</p>
<p><strong>Update</strong> In honour of the app being back on the App Store, Don's made SCOtutor for iBooks Author <a href="https://target.georiot.com/Proxy.ashx?grid=9646&id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=162397&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=3664&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fapp%252Fscotutor-for-ibooks-author%252Fid525238808%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30" target="itunes_store">free for the time being</a>.</p>
