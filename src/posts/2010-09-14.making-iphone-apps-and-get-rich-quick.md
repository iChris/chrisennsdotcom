<p>There are a ton of spammy, scuzzy looking get rich quick sites out there promising you millions of dollars if you would just buy their e-book, sign up for their newsletter or retweet their message on twitter.</p>
<p>I came across <a href="http://d6c4e5feqj1b2-49v7gkm4plsj.hop.clickbank.net/">this site</a> <em>(p.s. that's an affiliate link that I get rich quick on if you click and buy.  Hypocrite!)</em> that promises to show you how to make yourself an iPhone app by outsourcing the development and then either selling it or cashing in through advertising on the app to make cash money online.  It's been ingrained in me since I was a kid that there's no such thing as a free lunch and if something seems too easy to do, then it's probably a scam.</p>
<p>But there's still a part of me that thinks, hmm, I wonder what would happen if I spent some time on the slightly darker side of the internet and tried selling some products, develop an iPhone app and started making some coffee money online.</p>
<p>It's something my brother-in-law (also named Chris) and I have been chatting about.  He's on the other side of the world in Byron Bay, Australia setting up a jewellery making business online.  He's started a <a href="http://mixedmetalworkshop.com/">blog</a> about the process of setting up his business, <a href="http://lostwaxoz.com/jewellery-2/">Lost Wax Oz</a>.</p>
