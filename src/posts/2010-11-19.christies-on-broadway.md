<p>We've been wanting to head over and try out the new Christie's on Broadway, Christie's Il Secondo, for awhile. We live close enough to walk to Christie's on 33rd and regularly buy their Focaccia, cookies and bread.  The Broadway location has added authentic Italian pizza - and pizza just happens to be one of my favourite food groups!</p>
<blockquote><p>...because they grasp the fundamental art of making delicious foods with an attention to detail that makes each item perfect. Too many restaurants serve you something that should come with a sign saying, “good enough.” I get the sense that the good folks at Christie’s don’t know what “good enough” means.</p></blockquote>
