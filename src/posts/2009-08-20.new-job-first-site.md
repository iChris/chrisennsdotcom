title: "New Job, First Site"
---
<p>As some of you know, I've recently started a new job with <a href="http://www.yastech.ca">Yastech Developments</a>, a local web design company.  I get asked what kind of sites I now work on and so I wanted to give you an example of one I recently helped on.</p>
<p>It goes without saying that at any job, you want to work on something you can truly be proud of and I get to work on a lot of great websites here, but I can honestly say that if I work on no other websites in my life, this one can and should live on as my legacy of my time as a web designer:</p>
