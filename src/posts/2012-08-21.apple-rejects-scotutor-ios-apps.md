title: "Apple Rejects SCOtutor iOS Apps"
---
<p>After an appeal, it <a href="http://themacscreencastguy.com/blog/2012/8/21/this-parrots-dead.html">looks like Don McAllister's hope of getting his SCOtutor apps back in the iTunes App Store are dead</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I pointed out the huge number of video tutorials on the iTunes store, but that was met with a virtual shrug and the comment that it will take them a long time to get round all the video tutorial apps to review.</p>
<p>  I pointed out several video tutorial apps that had been reviewed and accepted into the store THIS MONTH but still no capitulation on the fact that they considered my Apps movies.</p>
<p>  I pointed out the rework of the SCOTutor Apps to included additional app functionality, but still they won't budge.

<p><em><a href="https://chrisenns.com/2012/08/apples-poor-handling-of-scotutor/">See my previous post for more explanation of what's happened thus far</a>.</em></p>
<p>Terrible situation for Don as I know he put a lot of work into making the iOS apps initially, and then even more work trying to get Apple to approve them upon removal. The only hope now is that someone higher up at Apple sees the complaint and reverses the decision in Don's favour.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, the SCOtutor for Mac apps are still available in the Mac App Store. Time to pick one up and support Don:</p>
