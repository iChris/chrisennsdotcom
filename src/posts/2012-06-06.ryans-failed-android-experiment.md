<p>He lasted longer than I would have, giving Google 3 years of his mobile life. But now he's <a href="http://blog.ghettio.com/2012/06/failed-android-experiment.html">back on iOS/iPhone</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  As a developer I have a consistent and predictable environment upon which I can create my applications. I have only a few devices, as opposed to several dozen, that I have to worry about supporting and testing. As a user I have a consistent and predictable user experience and upgrade cycle. As an uncle I have a camera that doesn't make you look like you have liver failure unless you're outside on a clear day in the high noon sun.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of the main reasons he gives for switching, the camera is the one that would've bugged me the most. A crappy mobile camera on my iPhone would make it useless to me. It's one of the reasons I didn't get an iPhone until the <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2010/10/iphone-4-review/">iPhone 4 came out with a HD capable video camera</a>.</p>
