title: "iPad Is Less of a Commitment"
---
<p>This is one of the reasons why I think the iPad is going to be a hit with folks once they give it a try:</p>
<blockquote><p>Part of it is the fact that I can go out on my terrace with a cup of coffee, a glass of lemonade, or a glass of wine and do email in a relaxed mood. If my wife or kids interrupt me, it's easy to put the thing down and engage in a conversation. <strong>The iPad makes using a computer less of a commitment and that has important implications for the way I compute.</strong> I like how I feel when I am using the thing.</p>
