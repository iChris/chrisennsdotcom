<p>I love documentaries on bands and the music industry.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The world fell in love with Glen Hansard and Markéta Irglová when their songwriting collaboration in the film "<a href="http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=6PFrOqNV4B8&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fca%252Fmovie%252Fonce%252Fid270012018%253Fuo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30">Once</a>" culminated in a jubilant Oscar win. But behind the scenes, where their on-screen romance becomes a reality, a grueling two-year world tour threatens to fracture their fated bond. This music filled documentary is an intimate look at the exhilaration and turmoil of both love and fame.
