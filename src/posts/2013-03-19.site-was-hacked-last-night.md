<p>My apologies if you saw a couple of posts about financial news last night on the site or via RSS - somehow a person/bot created a user account on my blog with administrator privileges and posted a couple of articles. I haven't figured out anything else they might have done but I will be <a href="http://sucuri.net">scanning the site</a> throughout the day and watching for anything else odd.</p>
<p>The place I noticed an odd setting was under Settings -> General (/wp-admin/options-general.php on your WordPress install):</p>

<p><strong>How It Should Be Configured:</strong></p>

<p>I don't think I set it up the way it was with anyone being able to register AND be given Administrator access - but I have had this blog running for a long time so maybe I did at one point and forgot to turn it off. Or maybe there's a backdoor somewhere in one of my plugins?</p>
<p><a href="http://sucuri.net">Sucuri</a> didn't turn anything up but like I said, I'll keep scanning throughout the day. Thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/claybitner/status/314033569272053760">@claybitner</a> for pointing it out to me this morning.</p>
