Like most people, I've been flailing around on social networks these days. I used to be a [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iChris) ride or die, but turns out Twitter basically dies when an egotistical man baby buys it and burns it down along with $20 billion dollars in the process.

So as of early 2024, here's **what** I'm posting **where**, **who** it's generally for, and **why** I am posting there. For the purposes of this post, I'm casting a fairly wide net in terms of I consider social media. Your mileage may vary.

[BeReal](https://bereal.com/ichris): Photos from the front and selfie camera at almost the same time with a caption once per day. For people I know IRL, and trust with seeing my kids, my home, and my location in the world at that exact moment.

[Retro](https://retro.app/i/ichris): One photo per day (sometimes more), old school Instagram style before filters. For people I trust, but not necessarily people I know IRL. Still sorting out where it fits exactly, but I like the focus on photos and how the past drops off your archive unless you give someone a key to see more.

[Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@ichris) / [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/ichris) / [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/ichris.bsky.social) / [Tumblr](https://fscte.tumblr.com/)/ [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/chrisenns/): Text and occasional photo which get cross-posted from [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/). For anyone who wants to follow along, but it feels slightly more niche than Twitter or Threads in terms of potential reach or influence. This group feels more like a weird 5 headed monster that used to just be what I'd post on Twitter pre-2020.

[Threads](https://www.threads.net/@ichrisv2): Text, photos, and the occasional video. Same general vibe as above, with the full knowledge that anything I post there could be shown to a family member on Facebook.

Instagram - Photos and videos in posts or stories. I have a [business](https://www.instagram.com/lemonpodcasting/) profile that's public, and a [personal](https://www.instagram.com/ichrisv2/) account that's private. The personal account is for people I trust or think I know, but not necessarily people I know IRL. Business account is for #marketing in the laziest sense of the word.

[Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/ichris): Text with the occasional photo / video. Used to be a public soapbox of sorts. These days apparently you can only see someone's pinned tweet if you're not logged in. I connect with a few local people, a sport (Go Winnipeg Jets!), and a dash of networking in the tech world. But most tech people have moved to Mastodon, Threads, or LinkedIn. I keep naively hoping it will return to it's former glory, but it just keeps getting worse and worse.

[Buttondown](https://buttondown.email/lemonpodcasting): Text with a photo. An email newsletter I send out once a week to ~35 of my best friends on the entire internet ðŸ˜‰. You can join anytime by [signing up](https://buttondown.email/lemonpodcasting).

[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/c/lemonproductionsca): Video, duh. I have a lot of audio / video tutorials on here. I keep hoping I'm going to find my way back to posting more, but haven't yet. Generally I post for the "How do I do..." on a Mac or iOS device crowd, with a focus on podcasting and live streaming.

[TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@lem0npodcasting): Video, duh. I go through addictive phases of watching too much TikTok. I post stuff on there for fun and to make myself laugh. But 55% of the time I'm very close to deleting my account out of stupid embarrassment.

[Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/lemonpodcasting): Live video, duh. I've done the occasional live stream (and on YouTube), but I think in 2024 once my [Covert Dock 2](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/humanthings/genki-alpine) arrives I'll use this channel to live stream my attempts at finally finishing [Breath of the Wild](https://zelda.nintendo.com/breath-of-the-wild/).

[Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/iChris#5728): Text, photos, videos. It's private forums for conversations and meme sharing among internet friends. I also use it with a [few clients](https://www.lemonproductions.ca/) for back and forth instead of email. I'm mostly active in the [ShopTalk Show d-d-d-d-d-discord](https://www.patreon.com/shoptalkshow), but also the [Goodstuff](https://goodstuff.network/) one, along with a bunch of software servers I visit occasionally.

On the one hand it's completely ridiculous that I spend time on any of these, but I do owe a lot of my initial work opportunities to being a silly guy on Twitter in it's early days. It's also my social water cooler as someone who works from home so I justify it in that sense as well.
