From her 2013 talk:

It's not about winning. It's not about losing. It's about showing up and being seen.

I want to create and make things. I want to show up and be seen in my work and my life. There is only one guarantee: you will get your ass kicked.

If you're not also in the arena also getting your ass kicked, I'm not interested in your feedback. If you're in the cheap seats, not putting yourself on the line, and just talking about how I could do it better, I am in no way interested in your feedback.

> It is not the critic who counts; not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs, who comes short again and again, because there is no effort without error and shortcoming; but who does actually strive to do the deeds; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions; who spends himself in a worthy cause; who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement, and who at the worst, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly,
