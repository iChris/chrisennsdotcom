This week [Apple announced a price increase on their media services](https://www.macrumors.com/2023/10/25/apple-services-price-increases/):

> In the U.S., ‌Apple TV+‌ is now $9.99 per month, up from $6.99 per month. ‌Apple Arcade‌+ is up $2 at $6.99, and ‌Apple News‌+ is now priced at $12.99 per month, up from $9.99 per month. ‌Apple One‌ Individual and Family are $3 more expensive, while Premier is $5 more. Prices are going up in most countries where Apple services are available.

Here in Canada, the [Apple One bundle pricing](https://www.apple.com/ca/apple-one/) went from:

- Individual / Family / Premier
- [Old pricing](https://web.archive.org/web/20230901180702/https://www.apple.com/ca/apple-one/) $18.95 / $24.95 / $37.95
- New pricing $22.95 / $28.95 / $44.95

Because we've got 5 people using iCloud+ storage with 1.2TB of 2TB being used, we're on the Premier tier. At $37.95/mo. it felt on the edge of being too high but justifiable for the time it saved me having to manage everyone's photo libraries, etc. But at the new $44.95/mo. price, I'm going to spend some time figuring out if it's actually worth it or not.

Due to our storage usage, we wouldn't fit in the Family plan with it's measly 200GB of storage. I've got over 500GB of Photos & videos alone. So if we went down to the Family Plan at $28.95/mo. and upgraded the storage to 2TB (which I think adds $9/mo. but I'm not sure), we'd be paying $37.95/mo. Which is what we were paying up until this week. So is Fitness+ and News+ worth an extra $7/mo for Premier?

I honestly don't know. We almost never use News+ on purpose. And Fitness+ is like most gym memberships where you use it for a few months and then spend the next 8 months feeling too guilty to cancel and too guilty that you're paying for it.

In all likelihood, another streaming service will likely get cut. [Netflix is now $16.49](https://help.netflix.com/en/node/24926) in Canada. We're almost finished Brooklyn 99. Sorry Netflix, time to say bye bye bye.
