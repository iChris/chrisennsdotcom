title: "Interview with Shawn Blanc"
---
<p>One blogger I read <sup id="fnref-19902:1"><a href="#fn-19902:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> is <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/">Shawn Blanc and his blog shawnblanc.net</a>. Around 10 months ago he took his blog full time by offering a <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/members/">members option for $3/month</a> in addition to the <a href="http://shawnblanc.net/sponsors/">sponsorship options</a>.</p>
<p>I had the opportunity to interview Shawn for my podcast, <a href="http://ssktn.com/shows/welcome-to-the-internet/">Welcome to the Internet</a>, and it just went live yesterday. <a href="http://ssktn.com/podcasts/welcometotheinternet/019-welcome-to-the-internet-shawn-blanc/">Listen to the interview</a>. It's one of the shows I'm most proud thus far in my podcasting career and it's great to see it getting such a good response. Within 2 days, it's already become the second most downloaded episode on <a href="http://ssktn.com">SSKTN</a> and has been listened to by people in lots of different countries than previous podcasts I've put out:</p>

<p>Apparently Shawn is pretty popular in Poland.</p>
