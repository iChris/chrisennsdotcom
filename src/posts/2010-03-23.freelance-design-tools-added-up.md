title: "Freelance Design Tools Added Up"
---
<p>There's a ton of great applications that work completely online (or in the cloud as it's commonly called).  How much do they actually cost?</p>
<p>Motivated by <a href="http://mashable.com/2010/03/23/social-media-design-tools/">this article on 10 Essential Design Tools for Social Media <del datetime="2010-03-23T19:04:02+00:00">douchebags</del> Experts</a>, I've put together a rough monthly cost of being a freelancing and trying to use the online tools recommended in the article, as well as a few others that I've used at various times.</p>
<p>For this article's sake, unless it's completely free I'll be using the cheapest paid plan from each service, even if they offer a free plan.  The free plans are designed to get you hooked on the service so you'll eventually be paying.  Trust me.  I'll use USD pricing as well.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Design</strong>: Besides the big monster Photoshop, <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">Gimp</a> is free to use though your mileage may vary as to how easy you find it to use.  Not that Photoshop is all that easy.</li>
<li><strong>Design Communities</strong>: Most should be free.  Some are <a href="http://www.dribbble.com">private</a>.  Find one you like and enjoy and are inspired by.</li>
<li><strong>Design Element Resources &amp; Icon Finder</strong>: Most of these are free as well.  There are definitely plenty of places to buy images, graphics, fonts, etc. and when the project calls for it, you'll certainly want to go with something paid for if you're not doing it from scratch.</li>
<li><strong>Mockups</strong>:  <a href="http://www.mockflow.com/signup/">Mockflow</a> is $59/year (<strong>$4.91</strong>/month).  <em>For the record, we use <a href="http://gomockingbird.com/">Mockingbird</a> at <a href="http://www.yastech.ca">Yastech</a> and it's free.  But I'm trying to prove a point here!</em></li>
<li><strong>Feedback / Collaborate Tools</strong>: <a href="http://www.notableapp.com/">Notable</a> is <strong>$24</strong>/month.  <em>This is one that you could probably get by on the free account for awhile.</em></li>
<li><strong>Email Newsletter</strong>: <a href="http://www.campaignmonitor.com/">Campaign Monitor</a> is recommended in the article.  It's priced on a quantity of emails sent basis.  So assuming you send out 1 email newsletter/month to 250 people you'd be spending $7.50/month.  <em><a href="http://www.mailchimp.com">Mailchimp</a> is a nice alternative that offers free sending up to 500 email addresses.</em></li>
<li><strong>Proposals / Quotes</strong>: <a href="http://www.proposable.com/">Proposable</a> will run you <strong>$19</strong>/month.  I personally prefer writing this up by hand, but there could be a benefit to having it outsourced.</li>
<li><strong>Invoicing</strong>: <a href="https://www.freshbooks.com/subscribe.php?ref=65492e6675308-1">Freshbook</a> is a great small/medium business invoicing system that I've used for <a href="http://www.lemonproductions.ca">my own freelance work</a>.  It will run you <strong>$19</strong>/month.  <em>I don't currently use it since I haven't been doing as much freelance work since starting a 'real' job at <a href="http://www.yastech.ca">Yastech</a>, but I'd definitely recommend it.</em></li>
<li><strong>Templates / Systems</strong>: Most of these should also be free, like <a href="http://960.gs/">the 960 gird system</a> they recommend in the article, though some templates/themes will have a price tag.  <a href="http://www.woothemes.com/amember/go.php?r=359&i=l0">WooThemes</a> will run you <strong>$15</strong>/month on top of an initial $125 startup fee.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of the original article, I'd add the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Project Management</strong>: <a href="http://basecamphq.com">Basecamp</a> at <strong>$24</strong>/month.</li>
<li><strong>Contact Management</strong>: <a href="http://highrisehq.com">Highrise</a> at <strong>$29</strong>/month.</li>
</ul>
<p>So totalling it all up, you're looking at just over <strong>$140/month</strong> to make use of these tools. Not really all that bad when you think about all the stuff you're getting done with these applications - but it is important to remember that they do add up.  That's the plus and negative of seemingly low monthly costs - by the end of the year you're spending over <strong>$1,600 each year</strong> on software.  It's important to re-evaluate these monthly costs to make sure you're actually getting your money's worth out of them.</p>
<p>Any other applications that I've missed or that you'd recommend instead?</p>
