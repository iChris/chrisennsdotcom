<p><strong>Spoiler warning</strong>: I don't have a fix for this <em>yet</em>. So if you're coming here from Google hoping that I have the answer to your problems, I don't. I'm merely documenting it here so that someone who does have the answer might stumble across it and leave a comment with the solution. If a hero does arrive, I'll remove this. Leaving a comment below should allow you to be notified of future updates. This also isn't a post about the beta of iCloud Photo Library. This is on iOS 8.3.</p>
<p><strong>Update 2015-06-30</strong>: I upgraded to iOS 8.4 today and am still seeing the same issue. Now up to 363 Items to Upload.</p>
<hr>
<p>I've gotten the "iCloud Photo Library Has Not Updated in x Days - Connect to WiFi to update." error for, as of this post, 21 days. And of those 21 days, I've been on WiFi pretty much non-stop.</p>

<p>That this official error message doesn't show up in Apple support anywhere [footnote]At least in my Googling it doesn't. I'd love to be proven wrong here.[/footnote] likely means very few users are experiencing it - or that they're not vocal enough to Apple about the error.</p>
<p>Things that could be going on:</p>
<ul>
<li>A very large video file that's trying to upload but keeps stalling out when I leave WiFi areas. (Unlikely since I'm usually home on WiFi for at least 12+ hour stretches.)</li>
<li>A corrupt image file that's unable to pass whatever error checking Apple has to make sure photos are uploaded properly. (Could be but there's no status/error message to show otherwise.)</li>
<li>Apple has blocked my iPhoto Library from updating. [footnote]Grasping at straws here. Maybe Tim Cook doesn't like my kids?[/footnote] (iPhoto Library on my iMac and MacBook Air are in sync and I'm able to add photos that way.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Or any number of other things could be happening but there's no way to know because "It Just Works™" so why bother exposing more detailed information to a user for troubleshooting, right?</p>
<h3>Things I've Tried</h3>
<ul>
<li>Turning off and turning iCloud Photos. It seemed to work and photos started uploading again. But eventually I got back to this same spot. [footnote]Warning: If you've started uploading to Flickr via their <a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/ca/app/flickr/id328407587?mt=8&uo=6&at=10l4Ki">great iOS app</a> while trying to sync your iCloud Photo Library, this creates a bunch of duplicate photos in that library. So now I have 36,539 photos to upload to Flickr before they're in sync. Hashtag duplicate photo hell.[/footnote]</li>
<li>Restarting my iPhone. Yes. Thanks to iOS 8.3's penchant for rebooting during app updates I've restarted my iPhone many times.</li>
<li>Random WiFi issues. My router's been restarted. I've been on other WiFi networks for long enough to start an iCloud update I'd think.</li>
</ul>
<p>So for now I'm stuck seeing that wonderful overlay once a day reminding me to get on WiFi and the constant status update at the bottom of my iPhoto library reminding me how many photos aren't actually backed up to iCloud. [footnote] 104 items to upload as of this post. [/footnote]</p>
