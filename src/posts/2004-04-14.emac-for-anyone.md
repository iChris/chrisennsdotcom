<p>I'm thinking of selling our eMac and putting the money towards an iBook for Sue - anyone interested?  I haven't totally decided to sell it but there's some good prices going for them on eBay so it's got me interested.</p>
<p>This is what you could buy right now if you were looking at a new eMac:</p>

<p>Mine is the 1Ghz model with more RAM (640MB) but less hard drive (a 60GB).  We bought it August 2003 so it still has 4 months of warranty on it.  I could throw on an extra 2 years of warranty for $200.  <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/ilife/">iLife '04</a> (Garageband) is on it, as is <a href="http://www.apple.com/ca/macosx/overview/">Panther</a>.  I think we may even still have the original box.</p>
<p>Even if you're not interested in buying it, if I listed it on ebay is $1000 a fair price?</p>
