title: "Setting Up the Microsoft Surface"

<p>Remember that fancy touch screen computer that Microsoft <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2007/06/21/microsoft-surface/">debuted awhile back</a>?  Check out <a href="http://kinesismomentum.wordpress.com/2009/04/16/skin-deep-usability/">this post describing how easy it is to setup</a> - including the fact that you have to use a keyboard and mouse to set it up.  Nice!</p>
