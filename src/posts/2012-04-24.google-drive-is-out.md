title: "Google Drive is Out"
---
<p>Google unveiled <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.ca/2012/04/introducing-google-drive-yes-really.html">their cloud storage option</a>, called Google Drive.</p>
<p>5GB for free. Pay to upgrade to more storage. iOS apps coming soon.</p>
<p>Nothing compelling enough to warrant switching from <a href="http://db.tt/czHe7sK">Dropbox</a> in my opinion. The competition will be good but I'm not interested in giving even more of my digital life over to Google. They've already got too much as it is.</p>
