<p>I visited our local Best Buy and chatted with a helpful salesperson there who said that Telus was launching the iPhone 4 on Monday (August 23rd) in Saskatchewan.  It seems like Telus could be the answer to my <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2010/08/12/the-one-about-the-iphone-4-in-saskatchewan/">iPhone 4 woes</a> I've been <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2010/08/19/no-sasktel-advertising-for-iphones/">occupying your time with</a>.</p>
<h3>Benefits/Drawbacks/Neutral Thoughts</h3>
<p><strong>Neutral</strong>: Same hardware pricing as everywhere, data & voice plans are the same as far as I can tell so far, possibly better roaming agreements in the states/overseas but not really sure.</p>
<p><strong>Benefits:</strong> Shared network agreement with Sasktel, visual voicemail is apparently included in their data plan (Rogers tacks on $8/month for it), better national coverage than Rogers.</p>
<p><strong>Drawbacks:</strong> I feel like there should be more because I've just always had it in my head that it went, in Saskatchewan anyway, Sasktel, Rogers then Telus/Virgin/the rest.</p>
<p>Now I'm not so sure - any thoughts?  <a href="https://chrisenns.com/2010/08/20/iphone-4-on-telus/#comments">Leave a comment</a> or <a href="mailto:chris.enns+telusiphone@gmail.com">drop me an email</a>.</p>
<h4>Update:</h4>
<p><a href="http://www.iphoneincanada.ca/telus-iphone/telus-to-soon-announce-hspa-coverage-in-saskatchewan/">Telus to Soon Announce HSPA Coverage in Saskatchewan</a>  Besides the terrible headline writing, that seems to be confirmation.</p>
