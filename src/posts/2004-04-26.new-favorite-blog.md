<p><a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/">Mark Cuban's blog</a> is quickly becoming one of my favorites.  He recently talked about how he got his money (<a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/7324322564475288/">part 1</a>,<a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/4622841295227252/">part 2</a>) and in his most recent entry, he <a href="http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/7661336245723213/">calls out The Don</a> to have a corporate meetup at Whitecastle.  I think Mark should hire me to do a reality blog on his life.  I'll just follow him around with a camera so when other famous people try to schmooz him and he calls them on it, he can back it up with video footage.</p>
